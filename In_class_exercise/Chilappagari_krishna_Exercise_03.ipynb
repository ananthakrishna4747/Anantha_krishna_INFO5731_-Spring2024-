              "'(Reuters) - The husband-and-wife owners of DC Solar, a California solar company that caused Warren Buffett\\'s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (,) to take a $377 million charge last year, pleaded guilty on Friday to involvement in an estimated $912 million Ponzi scheme. ,Jeff Carpoff, 49, pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while Paulette Carpoff, 46, pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. ,They entered their pleas in federal court in Sacramento, California. Jeff Carpoff faces up to 30 years in prison and Paulette Carpoff up to 15 years at their May 19 sentencing. ,Prosecutors called the criminal fraud scheme the largest in the Eastern District of California, which includes Sacramento. ,They said that from 2011 to 2018, DC Solar entered $2.5 billion of transactions to sell mobile solar generators meant to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sports events, attracting investors with associated federal tax credits. ,But according to prosecutors, about half of the 17,000 generators did not exist, and the Benicia, California-based company used false financial statements and lease contracts to conceal the fraud. ,Authorities said the Carpoffs siphoned money to fund a lavish lifestyle including dozens of properties and vacation homes, a Nascar sponsorship, a stake in a private jet service, a holiday party featuring the rapper Pitbull, and at least 150 cars. ,Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Jeff Carpoff, said in an interview that his client \"feels terrible that this business started out intending to provide clean energy and tax benefits to many large corporations, but unfortunately failed and resulted in his committing a number of illegal acts.\" ,Paulette Carpoff\\'s lawyer Bill Portanova said in an interview: \"She regrets absolutely what she did, and is looking forward to the difficult job of making amends.\" ,The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the couple. ,Authorities said more than $120 million has already been forfeited from the scheme, including a 1978 Pontiac Firebird once owned by the actor Burt Reynolds. ,Last May, Berkshire said it had taken the $377 million charge in the prior quarter, after concluding that tax benefits it had accepted concerning investments in tax equity investment funds from 2015 to 2018 were \"not valid.\" ,Buffett\\'s assistant confirmed at the time that the charge related to DC Solar. ,Last February, DC Solar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Reno, Nevada.'"

            "Rank 1: Similarity 0.6731584072113037 - MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's competition watchdog said on Friday it has launched proceedings against Facebook for non-compliance with a request to correct improper commercial practices in the group's treatment of user data. ,In November 2018 the watchdog ruled that Facebook had not informed users properly about the collection and use, for commercial reasons, of the data they release.  ,It fined the U.S. company 5 million euros ($5.5 million) and asked it to publish an amending statement on the homepage of its website for Italy, on the Facebook app and on the personal page of each registered Italian user.  ,On Friday the regulator said in a statement that Facebook had not done so and the company could face another fine of up to 5 million euros. ,A spokesperson for Facebook said the group was reviewing the decision. ,The company made changes last year, including to its Terms of Service, to further clarify how it makes money, the spokesperson said. ,\"These changes were part of the group's ongoing commitment to give people more transparency and control over their information.\"\n",
            "Rank 2: Similarity 0.6609410047531128 - (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (,) on Friday urged a federal judge to throw out a General Motors Co's (,) lawsuit accusing Fiat Chrysler of racketeering and bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union to put GM at a multibillion dollar labor cost disadvantage.  ,Fiat Chrysler's motion to dismiss GM's civil racketeering lawsuit was expected. The company has said GM's lawsuit is baseless and aimed at disrupting the Italian-American automaker's proposed merger with France's Peugeot SA (,).  ,GM general counsel Craig Glidden told reporters in November the FCA-PSA merger had nothing to do with GM's legal action.  ,Fiat Chrysler's arguments were filed on Friday evening in   U.S. District Court in Detroit. ,In response, GM said it remained confident in the legal underpinnings of its case and will respond in court. ,\"We are confident in the legal and factual underpinnings of our case, which have already been documented in part through the guilty pleas and admissions of FCA executives made in connection with the government's ongoing criminal investigation\", GM said in a statement. ,GM sued Fiat Chrysler in November charging its rival with bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union in order to gain advantages in 2009 and 2015 labor contracts and have the UAW withhold those terms from GM. Fiat Chrysler's now deceased Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne sat \"at the center\" of the schemes, GM charged in its lawsuit.  ,In its response Friday, Fiat Chrysler rejected GM's claim that Marchionne tried to force a merger between GM and FCA by agreeing to labor contracts that favored the UAW. ,GM failed to show \"why Mr. Marchionne would want to saddle FCA and GM with unfavorable CBAs (collective bargaining agreements) if his ultimate goal was to run the merged company (presumably on a profitable basis).\"  ,GM's accusations relied in part on revelations from an active federal criminal investigation of corruption within the UAW. That investigation began at Fiat Chrysler but has since spread to past and present UAW officials at GM. ,In its motion on Friday, Fiat Chrysler said GM's lawsuit was \"fatally flawed\" for several reasons.  ,The lawsuit was filed after a four-year statute of limitations had expired, Fiat Chrysler argued. GM is not a direct victim of wrongdoing by FCA executives or UAW officials related to labor contracts, and so cannot bring a RICO action, FCA argued in its motion.  ,The UAW is such a large organization, \"the notion that FCA seized control of the UAW by virtue of the alleged prohibited payments is implausible on its face,\" the FCA brief stated.  ,Further, Fiat Chrysler argued that GM's allegations about corrupt contract negotiations should be heard by the National Labor Relations Board, not by a federal court.\n",

Jeff Carpoff faces up to 30 years in prison and Paulette Carpoff up to 15 years at their May 19 sentencing. ,Prosecutors called the criminal fraud scheme the largest in the Eastern District of California, which includes Sacramento. ,They said that from 2011 to 2018, DC Solar entered $2.5 billion of transactions to sell mobile solar generators meant to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sports events, attracting investors with associated federal tax credits. ,But according to prosecutors, about half of the 17,000 generators did not exist, and the Benicia, California-based company used false financial statements and lease contracts to conceal the fraud. ,Authorities said the Carpoffs siphoned money to fund a lavish lifestyle including dozens of properties and vacation homes, a Nascar sponsorship, a stake in a private jet service, a holiday party featuring the rapper Pitbull, and at least 150 cars. ,Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Jeff Carpoff, said in an interview that his client \"feels terrible that this business started out intending to provide clean energy and tax benefits to many large corporations, but unfortunately failed and resulted in his committing a number of illegal acts.\" ,Paulette Carpoff's lawyer Bill Portanova said in an interview: \"She regrets absolutely what she did, and is looking forward to the difficult job of making amends.\" ,The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the couple. ,Authorities said more than $120 million has already been forfeited from the scheme, including a 1978 Pontiac Firebird once owned by the actor Burt Reynolds. ,Last May, Berkshire said it had taken the $377 million charge in the prior quarter, after concluding that tax benefits it had accepted concerning investments in tax equity investment funds from 2015 to 2018 were \"not valid.\" ,Buffett's assistant confirmed at the time that the charge related to DC Solar. ,Last February, DC Solar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Reno, Nevada.\n",

The Pentagon and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  ,Commerce in May placed Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. That allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of American-made goods to the company and a small number of items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.         ,Under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, fueling frustration among China hawks within the administration and a push to expand U.S. authority to block more shipments to Huawei. ,Reuters reported in November that the Commerce Department was considering broadening the rule that dictates how much American content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to regulate exports. ,The United States, under current conditions, can require a license or block the export of many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries, if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. ,Commerce drafted a rule that would lower the threshold only on exports to Huawei to 10% and expand the purview to include non-technical goods like consumer electronics including non-sensitive chips. ,The draft rule was then sent to the Office of Management and Budget, where agencies, including the Department of Defense, were given until Wednesday to submit comments, one of the people said. When the Pentagon expressed disagreement with the proposal, Commerce pulled it out of the review process in an unusual move.   ,U.S. businesses have pushed back against the measure, arguing that enabling the government to regulate more sales to Huawei to include low-tech items made overseas with very little U.S. technology would end up needlessly hurting American companies while encouraging Huawei to source more goods abroad. ,But many in Congress and the Trump administration have criticized the Commerce Department for not doing more to thwart Huawei, and for its slow rollout of rules to limit exports of sophisticated technology to China. ,Senators Tom Cotton, Ben Sasse and Marco Rubio, all Republicans on the Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote to Defense Secretary Mark Esper to demand a rationale for the department's reported objections. ,\"Huawei is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and should be treated as such. It is difficult to imagine that, at the height of the Cold War, the Department of Defense would condone American companies contracting with KGB subsidiaries because Moscow offered a discount. We are concerned that the Defense Department is not appropriately weighing the risks,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter. ,Separately, Cotton said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the reports. ,They additionally asked how the Defense Department's position affected its efforts to stop allies from using Huawei in their networks and asked for a briefing on the matter within 60 days.\n",
            "Rank 6: Similarity 0.6436748504638672 - WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long accused of being too soft, a U.S. bank regulator has surprised its critics with tough treatment of scandal-ridden lender Wells Fargo, culminating on Thursday in more than$58 million in fines against eight former executives at the bank. ,Consumer groups had worried that the Trump administration's pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Joseph Otting, would do little to change its reputation for leniency. A former chief executive of California's OneWest Bank, Otting as comptroller has referred to lenders as his \"customers\" and pursued rule changes pushed for by bank lobbyists. ,But when it comes to Wells Fargo's sales practices, Otting has consistently been a harsh critic, driving penalties against the bank which have broken new ground. One person with knowledge of the matter said Wells Fargo's failure to swiftly fix systemic misconduct has angered Otting, precisely because he spent decades as a banker and felt he was held to high standards.  ,\"You would get far more significant penalties from someone who has been in the business and is disappointed in what Wells Fargo has done,\" said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University and former OCC official.  ,On Thursday, the OCC banned former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf from the banking industry and fined him $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to put a stop to sales misconduct - the most it has ever secured from an individual. Among other former executives charged was retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who has not yet settled and is potentially facing a whopping $25 million penalty. ,After watchdogs including the OCC failed to charge senior Wall Street executives for their role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, lawmakers have pressed them to hold more individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing. Proving personal culpability, though, is legally tough, which makes Thursday's charges all the more striking. ,\"The OCC actions are eye-popping in terms of the number and seniority of the individuals charged,\" said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, adding there had not been such a high profile executive crackdown in recent memory. ,Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University, said he was \"surprised\" the OCC had pursued such drastic charges. \"It's fair to say they've always been viewed as probably the most bank-friendly regulator,\" he added. ,On Thursday, Otting said in a statement that the charges \"reinforce the agency's expectations that management and employees ... provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly and comply with applicable laws.\" ,In addition to Thursday's charges, the OCC fined Wells Fargo $500 million in 2018 for product mis-selling, only the second time it has dished out a penalty of that size.  ,That settlement requires the bank to make extensive fixes and to repay harmed customers, an effort the OCC has been monitoring closely. It also imposed novel restrictions on the bank by giving the OCC the right to remove current executives and to vet new ones.  ,Otting's frustration with Wells Fargo's slow progress on its remediation effort was laid bare in March last year. Then-CEO Tim Sloan had just finished telling Congress the bank was back on track, when the OCC responded with a rare public rebuke saying it continued to be \"disappointed\" in the bank.  ,The comptroller's public loss of confidence in Sloan contributed to his abrupt departure later that month, Reuters reported at the time. ,Wells Fargo has said repeatedly it was making every effort to fix its problems. On Thursday, the bank's new CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement Wells Fargo had made \"fundamental changes to its business model, compensation programs, leadership, and governance.\" ,By being strict with Wells Fargo, the OCC may also be trying to shed its image as a soft touch, said Wilmarth. ,\"You hammer this one bank and its executives ... and when people accuse you of being bank-friendly, you say, 'Look how tough we were on Wells Fargo!'\" he added. ,The OCC was lambasted for missing signs of the brewing financial crisis and was again criticized for failing to catch Wells Fargo's problems in the first place. An internal OCC review found its examiners failed to follow-up on red flags, including hundreds of whistleblower complaints.  ,While Otting is personally aggrieved by the bank's lapses, he has also been under pressure from lawmakers to take a tough line. The pressure has come particularly from progressive U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has voiced sometimes stinging skepticism of the agency.  ,\"No one has been tougher on Wells Fargo than myself,\" Otting told Warren when defending his record before Congress in May. \"At the OCC?\" Warren replied. \"That's a low bar.\"\n",

            "Rank 9: Similarity 0.6332392692565918 - MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market. ,To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than $1 billion, Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices - no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street's biggest oil trade.  ,Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending, the economy is stagnating and the country's credit-worthiness is under intense scrutiny. ,Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks, the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market, making it harder, and more costly, for Mexico to arrange. ,For its 2020 hedge, however, Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years, according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal. ,This time, an estimated two-thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark, shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces, according to the source. ,By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent, Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves, market sources said.     ,But critics say the strategy creates new risks. By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico's export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent. ,\"I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,\" said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP https://opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being \"worthless.\" ,The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge. ,The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.  ,For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed. ,The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.  ,Brent LCOc1 is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya's official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data. ,The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference - acting effectively as an insurance policy. ,But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude - or Maya drops and Brent rises - Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said. ,Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump. ,Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent. ,Mere rumors of Mexico's \"Hacienda hedge,\" which gets its name from the country's finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade. ,\"Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it,\" said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018. ,In part due to this, the hedge's cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed. ,Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.  ,Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they're spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs. ,\"What we don't want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,\" Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month. ,The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed. ,Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they're protecting, nor to what extent they're using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue. ,All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel. ,(Graphic: Mexico oil hedge - ,) ,Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed. ,Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead - at least before including the cost of the 2020 program. ,Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters' records request, Mexico's transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years. ,It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico's monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk. ,\"This is part of Mexico's strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,\" said Gomez. ,Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico's oil exports. ,Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston - a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade - and 35% on Brent futures. ,Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel. ,Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments. ,From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies. ,For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.  ,Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.  ,\"They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,\" Gomez said. ,Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world's most heavily indebted oil company. ,\"In congress, many will say they don't agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn't be spent on the oil hedging program,\" Ruiz said.  ,\"But Mexico's finances would become a lot more volatile without it.\"\n",

Wet'suwet'en chiefs have said several of their people were denied passage, which RCMP said was the result of miscommunication. ,Last month, private equity firm KKR & Co Inc and Alberta Investment Management Corp (AIMco) agreed to jointly buy a 65% stake in Coastal GasLink. ,AIMco spokesman Denes Nemeth said the corporation has confidence in TC Energy's ability to deal with opposition, and KKR declined to comment.   ,Construction continues on the pipeline, but not at a site where the chiefs say ancient stone tools were unearthed last year, Coastal said. The company has requested meetings with the chiefs, who have denied them. ,Their opposition caused the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination last month to call for construction to stop on Coastal and two other western Canadian resource projects until they garner greater indigenous support. ,Committee Chairperson Noureddine Amir said he was unaware that Coastal had broad indigenous backing. ,\"I did not know that most First Nations agree on that. This is something new that comes to my understanding,\" Amir said in a phone interview from Algiers. Asked why the committee did not gather more information, Amir said its role does not include investigations. ,A court injunction allows police to prevent disruptions to construction, but any arrests could backfire, said Dwight Newman, a law professor at University of Saskatchewan. ,\"Arresting some people doesn't necessarily mean that other people go away.

            "Rank 11: Similarity 0.6195506453514099 - BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain's impending decision on whether to allow Huawei [HWT.UL] to supply equipment for 5G mobile networks comes at a delicate time, with debate raging in European capitals over the security implications of reliance on Chinese technology. ,In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's preference for applying the same rules to all equipment vendors faces growing resistance from lawmakers in her own party, who back U.S. calls to ban Huawei outright. ,Even as Britain prepares to quit the European Union, the finishing touches are still being put on a bloc-wide framework to address risks in networks that will become faster and more ubiquitous in the 5G era. ,Europe's leading telecoms operators, all Huawei customers, are lobbying against an outright ban. At the same time, they are removing the Chinese company's gear from the \"core\" of their networks. The core routes traffic and manages data and is thus more sensitive than the peripheral radio network. ,Here's an explainer on the current state of play: ,In Germany, lawmakers across party lines are challenging Merkel's pragmatism. They agree with the Donald Trump administration's arguments that Huawei can't be trusted because it is beholden to the Chinese government. Huawei denies this. ,Merkel has called for a time-out on the domestic debate ahead of a March EU summit, reinforcing a feedback loop that Brussels sources say has already slowed efforts to reach a bloc-wide consensus and delayed the 5G framework, dubbed the toolbox. ,Concerns expressed by Germany's powerful car industry that a Huawei ban could provoke trade retaliation from China - its largest export market - have influenced the thinking of Merkel and senior aides. ,Operators Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica are all Huawei clients. They warn that replacing its kit could cost billions of euros, on top of heavy outlays for German 5G spectrum at auction last year. ,More broadly, Europe has emerged as a battleground in the technology 'Cold War' playing out between China and Washington. Huawei's European competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, would become a supplier duopoly should the Chinese company be shut out. ,Huawei leads the global telecoms equipment market with a 28% share, according to U.S. consultancy Dell'Oro. Nokia was second on 16% and Ericsson third with 13%. Its share is higher in Europe and it is banned in the United States. ,The toolbox will create a framework to analyze and address network security issues, sources say. It will be able to make recommendations only because EU rules stipulate that security policy is a matter for national governments. ,The critical factor will be whether the toolbox explicitly differentiates between vendors deemed trustworthy and those where closer scrutiny and mitigating steps are required. ,There would be no up-front bans, but European Commissioner Thierry Breton, of France, has made it clear - in a coded message to Huawei - that the EU will assert its status as a sovereign space when it comes to telecoms networks. ,In France, market leader Orange, which is partly state owned, does not use Huawei for its domestic network. It does, however, rely on Huawei in Spain and Poland. ,Rivals Bouygues Telecom and Altice Europe's SFR are both Huawei customers, which raises potential uncertainty as France prepares to sell 5G spectrum early this year. ,Across the EU, no government has yet imposed an outright ban on Huawei. Attitudes range from welcoming to skeptical, reflecting diverging risk perceptions and attitudes towards Washington and Beijing. ,At the friendly end of the spectrum, there has been scant debate in Spain about any risks that Huawei might pose. Hungary has welcomed Huawei, saying it sees no evidence to support U.S. claims about security risks. Austria wants to coordinate with its European partners. ,Among the skeptics, the Czech Republic's cyber-security watchdog has issued a warning to all critical network companies, identifying risks of equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei and the smaller ZTE. ,Elsewhere, the Netherlands and Italy have talked about retroactive mechanisms for removing Chinese equipment should it be found wanting. Poland might impose stricter security requirements on elements of the network core that route traffic and handle sensitive information. ,Taken as a whole, Europe appears to lack the appetite for outright bans, and any consensus reached on a standards-based toolbox would represent a big win for Huawei. That would not, however, eliminate the risk that it is kicked out of individual markets at a later stage.\n",

Canada had no sanctions against Iran when the extradition process began. ,The judge said she would reserve her decision for a later date. Lawyers connected to the case expect a written judgment before April 27, when Meng is set to call evidence related to her arrest, which she alleges was improperly conducted. ,On Thursday, in their final arguments Meng's lawyer, Scott Fenton, told the judge that the U.S. request to extradite Meng is \"all and only about sanctions risk.\" ,Fenton said that to side with the prosecution, and allow Meng to be extradited, would be an embarrassment to the Canadian judicial system. ,\"The court is being embarrassed. There can be no fraud here because all risk to HSBC is based on underlying sanctions risk which cannot exist in Canada,\" he told the judge. ,The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. ,But Meng's legal team argued that \"double criminality,\" is the central issue in this case. Under Canadian extradition laws, a person can only be extradited if the offense they are alleged to have committed in another country is also considered illegal in Canada. This is commonly called \"double criminality.\" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized the start of the extradition process, her lawyers have said. ,If the judge finds that double criminality has not been met, then Meng would be free. However, the prosecution could immediately appeal the decision. Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached due to appeals.    ,Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. She entered court wearing a white polka dot dress with a long-sleeved black top and stiletto heels that she has often favored during the trial. ,Meng's lawyers acknowledge that between 2011 and 2016, Canada had economic sanctions against Iran, but that at the time the U.S. requested Meng for extradition, Canada had already done away with sanctions against Iran, \"along with the rest of the civilized world.\" ,The case is therefore inherently political because it is about whether Canada imports the U.S. sanctions law — a \"political law\" — and applies it to an extradition request, said Richard Peck, one of Meng's lawyers. ,On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that Meng should be extradited on fraud charges, and that contrary to her defense argument, the case is not solely about violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. They argued that the judge's job was to \"ensure that Canada doesn't become a safe haven for fraudsters.\" ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June.

They can, in certain circumstances, order the detention of a suspect pending trial, or issue an international arrest warrant if the suspect is abroad. ,Asked by Reuters to comment, Jean-Yves Le Borgne, one of Ghosn's legal team, said Ghosn had done nothing wrong over the party, but there may have been a misunderstanding between Versailles and party planners working for Ghosn. ,The lawyer said Ghosn had offered to pay back the 50,000 euros ($55,470) cost of renting the venue for the party. ,\"Carlos Ghosn is ready to answer French justice.

He last month slipped out of Japan, where he was subject to strict bail conditions, managing to board a private jet to Turkey and from there flying to Lebanon, his childhood home. ,He says the Japanese charges were fabricated as part of a plot to oust him from the Renault-Nissan alliance. ,The party at Versailles, principal residence of generations of French kings until the French revolution of 1789, took place on Oct. 8, 2016.

The companies deny the allegations. ,Bezos said on Wednesday Amazon would invest $1 billion to bring small businesses online in the country, adding to the $5.5 billion the company had committed since 2014. ,\"They may have put in a billion dollars but then if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,\" Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal told a security conference in New Delhi. ,\"So it's not as if they are doing a great favour to India  when they invest a billion dollars.\"     ,Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ,Ahead of Bezos' visit, the Competition Commission of India launched a probe into Amazon and Flipkart to look at allegations of deep discounting and whether the companies discriminate against small sellers. ,The allegations were \"an area of concern for every Indian\", Goyal said.     ,India only allows foreign e-commerce firms to operate marketplace platforms where third-parties sell goods to retail consumers. Small retailers say Amazon and Flipkart circumvent those rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors through which it offers deep discounts, allegations the companies deny. ,Goyal welcomed Amazon's investment over recent years, but questioned whether the funds merely covered losses incurred through discounting. ,Amazon's marketplace unit in India reported a loss of 56.85 billion rupees ($802 million) in the fiscal year ending March 2019, the Economic Times reported in October, citing filings on India's Registrar of Companies. Reuters could not immediately access the filings. ,\"How can a marketplace make such a big loss, unless they are indulging in predatory pricing or some unfair trade practices?

But he called for \"rebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel.\" ,Markey's comments came in a press release, with a copy of a Dec. 20 from Tesla addressing some of the Democratic senator's concerns attached. ,Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. ,Crashes involving Autopilot have raised questions about the driver-assistance system's ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. ,There are mounting safety concerns globally about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. ,Markey cited videos of Tesla drivers who appeared to fall asleep behind the wheel while using Autopilot, and others in which drivers said they could defeat safeguards by sticking a banana or water bottle in the steering wheel to make it appear they were in control of the vehicle.  ,Tesla, in its letter, said its revisions to steering wheel monitoring meant that in most situations \"a limp hand on the wheel from a sleepy driver will not work, nor will the coarse hand pressure of a person with impaired motor controls, such as a drunk driver.\" ,It added that devices \"marketed to trick Autopilot, may be able to trick the system for a short time, but generally not for an entire trip before Autopilot disengages.\" ,Tesla also wrote that while videos like those cited by Markey showed \"a few bad actors who are grossly abusing Autopilot\" they represented only \"a very small percentage of our customer base.\" ,Earlier this month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was launching an investigation into a 14th crash involving Tesla in which it suspects Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.     ,NHTSA is probing a Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California.

It also broke new ground for the regulator, which forced Stumpf to pay $17.5 million to settle the charges against him - the largest ever penalty it has secured from an individual.  ,The OCC's probe is one of several into the San Francisco-based lender, with investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission ongoing. One person with knowledge of the OCC probe said it was far-reaching and that more individuals could be charged. ,\"We do not expect these penalties will end Wells Fargo's troubles in Washington...Yet this is still a positive development for Wells Fargo as this was a hurdle that the bank was always going to have to clear,\" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note. ,Some of the OCC's findings, though, contradict Wells Fargo's 2017 board report into the scandal, which largely pinned the blame on a small number of executives, in particular the bank's former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt. But on Thursday, the OCC said many members of the bank's senior leadership were culpable, a finding that is likely to spark further questions by lawmakers who may push for criminal convictions, said Sieberg.  ,In addition to Stumpf, former human resources head Hope Hardison and Michael Loughlin, former chief risk officer, settled the OCC's charges for $2.25 million and $1.25 million, respectively, the OCC said.  ,Stumpf, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also agreed to a lifetime ban on working for an OCC-regulated bank. He abruptly left the company in October 2016 after a nearly a decade at the helm. ,Five other former executives refused to settle, including Tolstedt who is facing a potential $25 million civil monetary penalty, James Strother, the former general counsel, and Claudia Russ Anderson, the former community bank group risk officer, who both face $5 million fines. They and two auditing executives may ultimately fight the charges before a judge under the OCC's administrative process.  ,\"Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing. A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie,\" a lawyer for Tolstedt said in a statement. ,In a statement, Strother's lawyer said the former Wells Fargo executive \"acted with the utmost integrity and transparency\" and that the OCC's charges are \"false and unfounded.\"  ,Russ Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment.  ,In a memo to Wells Fargo employees, CEO Charlie Scharf said the company was reviewing Thursday's filings and will determine what, if any, further action is appropriate in respect to any of the individuals who were named. The memo added that the bank would not make any remaining compensation payments that may be owed to those individuals in the meantime. ,Wells Fargo, the country's fourth largest U.S. lender, has paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties since the 2016 revelation that the bank's sales practices encouraged employees to open potentially millions of unauthorized bank accounts in order to hit lofty sales targets.  ,Since then, internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo's major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The fallout has also resulted in the Federal Reserve imposing an unprecedented growth restriction on Wells Fargo's balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls. ,While Wells Fargo has inked multiple federal and private settlements for its sales practices, the OCC action marks the first federal action against individuals for their roles in the scandal, instead of just the institution.  ,In its complaint, the OCC said that senior bank leadership must have been aware of rampant sales misconduct, citing large numbers of employee complaints and years' worth of other evidence. For example, an internal investigation conducted by the bank in 2004 found that instances in which staff \"gamed\" the sales system to meet targets climbed 979% from 2000 to 2004. ,The number of calls to the bank's internal ethics hotline steadily climbed from 2006 through 2014, the OCC said, with nearly half of all cases investigated related to sales misconduct.\n",

Fraud not sanctions violations is at the heart of this case,\" Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater told the court in his opening remark on Wednesday. ,He said even when considering the foreign legal context of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the case for fraud can still be made. ,Unlike the defense which encouraged the judge to consider the importance of Canada's independence and absence of sanctions against Iran, the prosecutors say the judge should think independently of that. ,\"Your job is not to stand up for Canadian sovereignty ... not to look at jurisdictional issues,\" Frater said. \"That tool is a matter for the executive .... you have a role that is described by statute\" he added. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. ,In their arguments on Wednesday, Canadian prosecutors cited Reuters stories in 2012 and 2013 about Meng, Huawei and a company called Skycom Tech Co Ltd that are cited in her indictment. ,The articles reported Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. ,Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. ,The indictment alleges that HSBC and other banks in part relied on Huawei's false statements – that it had not violated sanctions on Iran and that Skycom was a local partner – to continue doing business with Huawei. The Chinese company has denied any wrongdoing. ,The hearing will resume Thursday. ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,On Wednesday, Meng sat beside her translator, behind her lawyers, pouring over documents with a pen in hand. The hearing is taking place in downtown Vancouver, in a specialized high security courtroom, with bulletproof glass separating the public gallery from the body of the courtroom. ,She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in part because her alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada, an argument known legally as \"double criminality.\" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition, her lawyers have said. ,\"The fact that Canada may have a different sanctions against Iran than the U.S. should not distract the court from the necessary inquiry into the essence of the conduct for double criminality purposes. Deceit and risk of loss are at the heart of the conduct,\" Canadian prosecutors have said in previous court submissions. ,On Monday, defense lawyer Richard Peck told the court that in a typical case, double criminality is not contentious. \"This case however is founded on an allegation of breach of U.S. sanctions, sanctions which Canada has expressly repudiated,\" he said. \"Sanctions drive this case,\" Peck said. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June.

Those devices have enabled a new world of connectivity - unlimited free calls over WhatsApp, for example, or an atlas worth of up-to-the-second maps from Google - but also a parade of potential security problems. ,Here is how smartphones can be hijacked and a look at the potential consequences and the thriving market in surveillance vendors helping the world's spies get access to people's secrets. ,Smartphones operate through a collection of apps, sometimes scores of them, running over an operating system, which in turn runs on a complex piece of hardware embedded with receptors, lenses and sensors. ,Each one carries potential flaws - sometimes called bugs - that can cause a system to crash or behave unexpectedly when sent a rogue command or a malicious file. Even small openings like that can allow hackers to take control of a device. It is akin to illicitly lowering a coat hanger through a tiny seam in the car door to unlock a vehicle.  ,Many developers work hard to ensure those seams stay sealed, but with millions of lines of code to choose from, it is virtually impossible to guarantee total safety. ,\"There is no software that is bugless,\" said Oded Vanunu, a researcher with Israeli cybersecurity firm Checkpoint who often finds flaws in popular messaging programs.  ,Once hackers are in, the possibilities are vast - and frightening. Anyone with full control of a smartphone can turn it into a powerful surveillance device, silently tracking users' locations while quietly copying their emails, instant messages, photos and more.  ,A 2015 technical document from NSO Group - one of the better known spyware vendors - outlines the capability of its Pegasus spyware program to monitor the smallest details of a target's life, throwing up alerts if a target enters a certain area, for example, or if two targets meet, or if a certain phone number is called.  ,The document, made public as part of a lawsuit against NSO by communications firm WhatsApp, shows how keystrokes can be logged, phone calls can be intercepted and a feature dubbed \"room tap\" uses a phone's microphone to soak up ambient sound wherever the device happens to be. ,The document says the spyware can be installed by enticing targets to click malicious links or rogue text messages, but spies particularly prize the quieter \"push message\" installations that remotely and invisibly install themselves on users' phones.  ,NSO and other spyware vendors have long argued that their products are used responsibly - only sold to governments for legitimate purposes. NSO has denied any link to the alleged Bezos hack. Saudi officials dismiss allegations of their involvement as absurd. ,Years of investigative work from internet watchdog group Citizen Lab - which has a well-documented record of exposing international cyber espionage campaigns - and a drumbeat of court cases and leaked documents have called such assertions as these of responsible use into question.  ,In October of last year messaging company WhatsApp sued NSO in California, alleging that the spyware firm had taken advantage of a bug in the app's video calling protocol to hack 1,400 users around the world in the period between April 29 and May 10, 2019, alone. ,Disclosures from other companies such as Italy's now-defunct Hacking Team and the spyware company now known as FinSpy have also raised questions about the business. Hacking Team's spyware was implicated in spying campaigns against dissidents in Ethiopia and the Middle East, for example, while researchers have recently found evidence that FinSpy's software was used in Turkey. ,Both companies' tools work similarly to NSO's — using flaws in smartphones to subvert the devices entirely.\n",
            "Rank 26: Similarity 0.5961170196533203 - (Reuters) - Fears about the future of energy assets have led to a sell-off, but this has created \"very good opportunities\" for the Carlyle Group, its founder, David Rubenstein, said on Thursday.  ,Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of the private equity (PE) giant, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum that securing bank loans for such deals had become harder, however. ,Big investors are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters, as climate change gains importance on the investment agenda. ,Rubenstein said he was \"very bullish\" on renewables and added that investors entering established PE funds today can expect mid-teen percentage rates of return through over the fund life-cycle. ,Below are excerpts from the interview, conducted on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland: ,Question (Q) - You've acquired a great deal of expertise across industry segments such as energy, financial services, manufacturing. Which of these look more appealing to you from an investment point of view now and why? ,Answer (A) - Right now, energy is relatively cheap and therefore we are looking at lot of assets where there has been a sell-off in the value, in part because people are nervous about the future of carbon energy. So we still think there are very good opportunities there.  ,In renewables, there's no doubt in your lifetime - probably not mine - renewables will probably be dramatically bigger than they are today and we have an opportunity there for people to invest with us. We're very bullish on renewables right now.   ,Q - Some people see conditions in parts of the credit market (leveraged loans, BBB-rated debt) worsening. Do you feel there are risks to how PE firms fund their deals, especially in the energy space with credit spreads widening? ,A - There's no doubt that getting energy loans is more challenging than it was before. Lenders are worried about it.  ,I think the biggest issue with respect to credit is this - when we do go into a down cycle and some deals don't work out, government regulators always like to come in and say, \"What can I do to make this better or 'how can I help you this morning'\" kind of thing? ,So, I think that it's possible that some regulators may say,  the debt lending is by the private equity firms themselves, their private credit businesses and not just private equity firms, but hedge funds and so forth, it's not really regulated. ,And so, there may be a look at some point to sort of try to see whether that part of the financial services world should be regulated.  ,Q - What sort of return on capital do you see money entering PE today earning over the fund life-cycle i.e. 7-10 years? ,A - I'd say generally people should expect mid-teen rates of return through good and bad times.  ,So I would say as an average, if you go into a mature, good, well-run private equity fund - not taking undue risks - I think something like 15% net is realistic and I think it's satisfactory to investors.\n",

HP's board rejected the offer saying it significantly undervalued the company. ,\"HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value, which is why we lined up $24 billion in binding financing commitments and a slate of highly qualified director candidates,\" John Visentin, Xerox's CEO, said on Thursday. ,HP, which has 12 board members, responded to Xerox's decision to nominate candidates by again saying the bid undervalues the company. ,The company added that the move to nominate members to its board was being \"driven\" by activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox. ,In December, Icahn urged HP shareholders who agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action.  ,The PC maker also said that due to Icahn's ownership position, he would stand to \"disproportionately benefit\" if a deal between the companies happens. ,\"These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,\" HP said in a statement. ,HP added that its board would review Xerox's director nominees and respond in due course. ,Xerox's slate of candidates include current or former executives from companies such as American Airlines, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Jefferies and Wynn Resorts. ,Both HP and Xerox have been facing a decline in demand as corporate clients choose to send emails rather than print out documents. ,While some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. ,\"I don't think (the nomination) puts enough pressure on HP to agree to a merger, but it may cause HP to consider negotiations for a higher valuation from Xerox,\" Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.   ,Shares of Xerox were down marginally at $36.24 while HP was up 0.8% to $22.10.\n",
            "Rank 29: Similarity 0.5821805000305176 - (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and its officials have racked up well over $4 billion (3 billion pounds) in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. ,Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: ,Probes: A number of federal agencies are examining the bank and its employees for potential wrongdoing. The Department of Justice is looking into whether executives withheld details about fake accounts to the Wells Fargo board of directors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the lead regulator for national banks, Reuters has reported. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Philadelphia office, meanwhile, has been investigating whether Wells Fargo misled investors by inflating performance metrics and whether the bank penalized whistleblowers, Reuters also reported. The Department of Labor is also examining whether the bank acted on staff  whistleblower complaints. ,Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the OCC, SEC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation.\t\t\t ,Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank's balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls.  Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public call with the company earlier this month, new Chief Executive Charlie Scarf did not set a new timeline.\t\t\t ,Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo's asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to \"Needs to Improve\" from \"Outstanding\" shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank's ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business that requires a higher CRA rating. \t\t ,More hearings: The bank's executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank's wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. New CEO Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing \"historical and \"legacy\" issues during his first call, but lawmakers are likely to continue rehashing Wells Fargo's mistakes in public. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee chair, said she plans to call Wells Fargo board members to testify this year.\n",

His was the harshest sentence in a case in which several former Insys executives will go to prison.  ,Forfeiture and restitution in Kapoor's case still needs to be determined. Government prosecutors are asking for about $113 million in forfeiture from a man who grew up poor in India, but became a billionaire before founding Insys.  ,During a hearing that lasted nearly two hours, U.S. prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs to sentence Kapoor to 15 years in prison. Some victims also asked her to give Kapoor a maximum penalty. ,Victims told the judge they were prescribed a highly addictive opiate that they did not need. They described losing their teeth and being unable to put two thoughts together as they lived in a haze of addiction. One victim told the judge Kapoor should be treated as a drug trafficker.  ,Burroughs said her lesser sentence took into account his central role in the crime, his many good works as a philanthropist and his age. ,Nevertheless, Kapoor is due to serve significantly more prison time than other former senior Insys executives convicted in the bribery and fraud scheme. ,On Wednesday, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich, 43, was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Babich last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate with the government. ,Over several days of testimony, Babich had described the inner workings of the conspiracy in detail. The trial resulted in the conviction of Kapoor, as well as the company's vice president of managed markets, Michael Gurry, national director of sales Richard Simon, and two Insys regional sales directors, Joseph Rowan and Sunrise Lee. ,Subsys, the company's fentanyl-based medication, was approved to treat intense pain in cancer patients. ,But Babich and others would identify high prescribers of opioid treatments and pay bribes or kickbacks to get them to broaden Subsys uses, increasing the number of new prescriptions, as well as dosage prescribed and units sold.     ,Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Yeager described Kapoor as the linchpin of the scheme.  ,\"It was a top-down conspiracy run by John Kapoor,\" Yeager told the judge.  ,Burroughs said she was not convinced Kapoor was the linchpin of the operation, but acknowledged he was a central player.   ,Kapoor, who served as the Chandler, Arizona-based drugmaker's chairman and later chief executive after Babich stepped down, apologized to the victims in the courtroom. ,\"I am heartbroken by the words of the patients,\" Kapoor said. \"I sincerely apologize to them.\" ,From 1999 to 2017, some 400,000 people died from overdoses involving an opioid, including prescription and illicit drugs, according to U.S. health officials.\n",

They stop only after receiving increasingly hefty payments. ,The attacks happened less frequently in 2019, but the problem remains significant, cybersecurity experts said. ,\"Ransomware is more sophisticated and dangerous than we saw in the past,\" said Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs. ,There were 6% fewer ransomware incidents in 2019 versus the prior year, according to Malwarebytes. However, attacks are now designed to spur deeper and more lasting technological problems, with hackers demanding bigger sums. ,The average ransom of $41,198 during the 2019 third quarter more than tripled from the first quarter, according to Coveware, which helps negotiate and facilitate the payments. ,Ransoms are becoming disproportionate to the size of targets, said Kelly Castriotta, Allianz SE (,) North American head of product development for financial lines. Hackers frequently pursue mid-size companies and other organizations that are less technologically adept, but also have less revenue to cover big ransoms. ,\"You'd expect a ransomware demand that you can pay,\" Castriotta said. ,The U.S. rate increases underscore broader global ransomware problems from which no company is immune. ,Ransomware recently crippled foreign-exchange firm Travelex Ltd's [TRVLXP.UL] systems for weeks, leaving staff to serve customers with pens and paper.

            "Rank 56: Similarity 0.5353115797042847 - LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's (,) has picked retail and operations director Simon Roberts to succeed CEO Mike Coupe, the architect of the British supermarket group's failed bid for rival Asda who will step down in May after six years at the helm. ,Roberts' task will be to grow earnings in the face of weakening consumer demand, Brexit, and the relentless march of German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which continue to win market share from Britain's big four grocers - industry leader Tesco (,), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons (,). ,On Jan. 10, Reuters reported that Roberts was the leading internal candidate to succeed Coupe. ,Coupe, 59, has faced questions about his future since April when Britain's competition regulator blocked Sainsbury's attempt to take over Walmart-owned (,) Asda for 7.3 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) and become Britain's biggest retailer.  ,Sainsbury's shares were down 2.3% at 1135 GMT, extending losses over the last year to 25%. ,All eyes will now be on whether Roberts, 48, will adapt a strategy set out by Coupe in September that was designed to show Sainsbury's could prosper on its own. ,It focused on cost cutting, paying off debt, investment in technology and further integrating the Argos general merchandise business Sainsbury's purchased for 1.1 billion pounds in 2016. ,Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said that, as an insider signed-up to the current strategy, Roberts was unlikely to start with a bang and a major move to significantly cut prices. ,\"He will only do so if trading were to deteriorate materially. But he has limited time to make up his mind and make it part of the honeymoon clean up,\" he said. ,Monteyne also said Roberts might review the future of Sainsbury's bank, which he said was unpopular with investors. ,Roberts, who started his retail career at 16 and is a former executive of health and beauty retailer Boots, joined Sainsbury's in 2017. ,\"Simon has been extremely effective during his three years at Sainsbury's, leading our store teams through great change in that time,\" said Chairman Martin Scicluna.     ,Roberts has re-built Sainsbury's operating model for its over 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores. He has invested in technology, implemented new leadership structures and standardised shop floor workers' contracts. That has driven efficiencies and improved product availability. ,\"I am really excited about working together with our 178,000 colleagues to become one multi brand, multi channel business,\" said Roberts, whose base salary will be 875,000 pounds. ,Sainsbury's said Coupe would remain a director from June 1 until the annual shareholders' meeting on July 2, at which point he will retire from the company he joined 15 years ago. ,\"This has been a very difficult decision for me personally,\" said Coupe, whose total remuneration was 3.9 million pounds in the 2018-19 year.      ,\"There is never a good time to move on, but as we and the industry continue to evolve, I believe now is the right time for me to hand over to my successor.\" ,Sainsbury's profit is forecast to fall in its 2019-20 financial year. ,Coupe's purchase of Argos was generally regarded as a big success and, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, Sainsbury's did not sacrifice a chunk of profit margin with a major price cutting campaign in response to the discounters. ,However, his tenure will likely be defined by the failure of the Asda transaction. ,Coupe will also be remembered for one of the most notable corporate gaffes of recent times.  ,He made unwanted headlines around the world shortly after the Asda deal was announced in May 2018 when he was caught on camera singing \"We're in the Money\". He apologised, saying he had been trying to compose himself before a television interview. ,Roberts' appointment means Britain's two biggest supermarket groups will be run by Boots alumni. ,Ken Murphy, who will succeed Dave Lewis as CEO of Tesco in the summer, was earlier in his career joint chief operating officer at Boots UK & Ireland along with Roberts. Murphy and Roberts are friends. ,Roberts also spent 15 years at clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer (,), where he had roles in stores and operations. ,\"He's got a great pedigree,\" said someone who has worked with Roberts. ,The person said Coupe and Lewis represented the last generation of \"command and control\" supermarket group CEOs. ,\"You've now got two guys whose real skill set isn't about knowing the answer to everything, their skill sets are being good guys that people want to work with…bringing the best out of others.\"\n",

It is being held in St. Louis, where Monsanto was headquartered before Bayer bought the company in a $63 billion deal in 2018. ,Three consecutive juries found the company liable for causing cancer with damages of tens of millions of dollars awarded to each plaintiff. Bayer is appealing those verdicts. ,Court-appointed mediator Ken Feinberg has put the number of Roundup cancer claimants at more than 75,000 while Bayer said the claims it has been served with in court were below 50,000.    ,Bayer's share price has tumbled since the first verdict in August 2018 but the stock rose 3% on Friday after Bloomberg reported a possible out-of-court settlement with some plaintiffs that could lead to a total payout of about $10 billion. ,While traders said the market likes the idea of Bayer settling the litigation, some cautioned that the prospect of a comprehensive deal remained uncertain. ,Analysts have estimated the size of any such settlement at $8-$12 billion. ,While most plaintiffs' lawyers have agreed to postpone trials pending negotiations, some have decided to pursue their clients' day in court. ,The case in Missouri's Circuit Court for the 22nd Judicial Circuit of the City of St. Louis is scheduled to last several weeks, with both sides presenting extensive scientific evidence through expert witnesses. ,Bayer denies all allegations that Roundup or glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use and noting that regulators around the world have approved the product. ,\"At the end of the day, this trial should come down to the weight of the science, and we remain confident in the extensive scientific record and regulatory assessments that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they do not cause cancer,\" the company said in a statement. ,Several court cases have been postponed by both parties in the past to expedite settlement talks. By pursuing the St. Louis trail The Miller Firm LLC, a key player in the litigation, is seeking to increase pressure on Bayer.     ,The case involves the claims of Bryce Batiste from Louisiana, Ann Meeks from Florida, Glen Ashelman from Pennsylvania and Christopher Wade, a St. Louis resident. All four have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a blood cell cancer that plaintiffs in the litigation allege is caused by Roundup. ,Some legal experts said Bayer could benefit from a home advantage in the St. Louis trial, where Monsanto has century-old roots.

In July, it delayed plans to launch a commercial robo-taxi service by the end of 2019, and still does not have a permit from California regulators to test self-driving cars without a safety driver. Alphabet Inc's (,) Waymo is the only company that has received permission to test without a driver. ,While car makers across the world are racing to develop self-driving vehicles, the technology has yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance as recent accidents involving such vehicles raised doubts about its readiness for public roads. ,\"We're obviously still working on something that's never been done before.

And even some policymakers agree. ,\"In my opinion the reserve has become negative,\" outgoing economy minister Mansour Bteish said in an interview.  ,Bteish estimates the shortfall between the central bank's liabilities to commercial banks - or hard currency deposits parked by lenders at the bank - and its own reserves at around $40 billion. ,Graphic: Hot spring for Leban, ,The central bank also holds $13.9 billion of gold and $5.7 billion of government holdings of dollar bonds.  ,While selling large quantities of gold is not that easy, countries under pressure such as Venezuela have mobilized their gold stacks as collateral for swap operations to gain access to hard currency. ,Yet Zouk points out that Lebanon using its gold could be tricky as parliamentary approval is needed to do so and domestic public opinion is strongly against such a move. ,And while it is unusual for a country's central bank and lenders to hold the foreign-denominated debt of their own sovereign, this could be a mitigating factor in the big debt repayments falling due soon, some analysts said. ,Lebanon faces interest and principal payments of nearly $4.4 billion in all in 2020.  ,\"Considering the foreign ownership is now 45%, the net impact on the BDL's foreign reserve position from these payments will be smaller than what the headline number would suggest,\" Morgan Stanley's Khurana said. ,While official data show that foreign currency reserves have held up better than many expected in recent months, trends in dollar flows - the grease that has kept Lebanon's financial engine running for years - are a cause for concern, said J.P.Morgan. ,\"While capital controls helped keep resident FX deposits unchanged, non-resident FX deposits decreased by $2.1 billion as of end-November alone and total 2019 deposit outflows amounted to $12 billion as of end-November,\" J.P.Morgan analysts wrote in a note. ,Beirut appears to be running out of road fast, said Oxford Economics' Zouk. He calculates that Beirut will honor its upcoming debt payments while leaving capital controls in place but that it will lack new dollar inflows while having to manage a current account deficit including a 30% compression of imports and additional foreign currency leakage of $2 billion a month. ,\"Add all these up, and reserves are gone by September.\"\n",

One airline said financing for pre-delivery payments had dried up amid the uncertainty - though the market won't be fully tested until closer to renewed deliveries. ,\"Even people who have committed to financing previously are wondering should I extend or should I just pull back to wait to see because they don't know the real value of their collateral going forward,\" said the head of an asset-management firm active in the sector, declining to be named to preserve relations with Boeing. ,\"Banks I think are getting a bit nervous,\" he said.  ,Boeing already risks losing some smaller customers who are pondering whether to revoke deals with lessors once delays of 12 months provide them with get-out clauses, according to consultant IBA, whose valuations underpin some financing deals. ,That in turn could push down lease rates - and the underlying value of the plane they imply.  ,\"Even when we're back under starter's orders and we've got certification, I still think there will be downward pressure\" on MAX lease rates, IBA Chief Executive Phil Seymour said. ,A deeper battle for Boeing is to convince its leasing mega-clients, who have orders worth tens of billions of dollars, that the MAX remains a long-term investment.  ,In that battle, Boeing is fighting on two main fronts, executives said: compensation talks and efforts to convince purchasers that the MAX production cycle will not be cut short, a step that would undermine the value of the plane.  ,Investors in Boeing shares and in MAX planes are watching closely as compensation negotiations determine how much of the financial pain of the crisis each side swallows.  ,\"Markets believe that indeed there is an enormous cost related to the situation,\" said Bertrand Grabowski, an aviation banker turned independent adviser. \"What isn't clear is how much, how that will be compensated and to whom.\" ,While several airlines have said Boeing agreed to compensate for MAX delivery delays, some lessors are arguing that falls in the value of the jet should also form part of the discussions.  ,AerCap, the world's largest aircraft lessor, said it was expecting Boeing to compensate it if it were forced to find new lessees for MAX jets dumped due to the delay.  ,\"Boeing will have to compensate me for that because we would be in a cancellation period and if we didn't get that we would just cancel,\" CEO Aengus Kelly said. ,The value of the plane will be \"part of the whole thing,\" he said on the sidelines of Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences. ,Kelly noted strains in the market, saying 'loan-to-value' - or the share of the MAX's purchase price that a bank will cover, may be lower than for a competing Airbus. Some lenders may try to \"extract some premium\" by raising borrowing costs, he added.   ,He said \"right now\" banks and lessors were willing to finance the MAX, putting a floor under its value as experts say the aviation sector remains awash with funds seeking returns.   ,\"If the banks were to lose confidence, that would be different,\" he added. ,The second crucial concern among those financing MAX jets surrounds whether Boeing could be forced to develop a replacement before the typical 15-20 years of production.  ,AerCap this week said it would make no sense for Boeing to replace the program until the next wave of fuel-saving technology is developed in a decade's time.  ,Lessors \"will focus a lot on when Boeing end up having to announce a replacement - which for us as asset owners would be the key to deciding whether it's something we want to invest in,\" said Paul Sheridan, CEO of lessor AMCK Aviation. ,Seeking to allay doubts, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said on Wednesday he expected the MAX to be flown for a generation.  ,But he also ordered a new market study after shelving plans for a slightly larger jet: an exercise that could encompass the market for planes like the MAX, analysts said.\n",

An advisory board will select the drugs. ,Civica will be able to sell the drugs at a lower price than a current manufacturer by leveraging the volume of prescriptions among its Blues plans members to guarantee discounts, Liljenquist said. The company may also manufacture drugs itself. ,Members will benefit from those lower prices based on their plan design, BCBSA strategy head Maureen Sullivan said. The lower cost to the Blues plans could translate into lower out-of-pocket spending, savings on the overall premium or potentially a lower co-pay or a co-pay waiver for patients, she said. ,About 78% of the $335 billion in annual U.S. drug spending goes to generic versions of branded drugs that have lost patent protection, according to generic industry trade group, the Association for Accessible Medicines.  ,Large generic drug manufacturers say price competition has severely crimped profits for many of their drugs, leading to industry consolidation.

            "Rank 86: Similarity 0.5015670657157898 - GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyana's government next month plans to begin a search for an oil company or trading firm to market its share of the South American country's crude, the director of the Department of Energy, Mark Bynoe, said in an interview.      ,The government is entitled to a portion of the light, sweet crude that a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp (,) began producing last month after making 15 discoveries in recent years. The finds are set to transform the economy of Guyana, an impoverished country of fewer than 800,000 people.     ,With no refining capacity, Georgetown last year began selling its share of crude through open-market tenders, the first one awarded to Royal Dutch Shell Plc (,) for loading the first three cargoes allocated to the government. After that, it will depend on a trading firm to sell its oil to export  markets as the state builds up capacity to do so itself, Bynoe said.     ,\"We don't yet have the kind of back office support that is necessary,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday afternoon in his office, lined with books on energy and development including historian Daniel Yergin's \"The Prize.\"      ,\"We're moving to this simpler methodology to be able to ensure that as we build out, we are not losing value.\"     ,Bynoe said the government next month expects to begin asking international oil companies (IOCs) and energy trading firms for proposals to operate as the agent.      ,But he said the selection would not necessarily be made before Guyana's March 2 elections, given the length of the bidding and evaluation process after launching the search.  ,Irfaan Ali, who is challenging President David Granger, has pledged to review the terms of oil deals signed by the current administration. He has argued that the government was not transparent in choosing Shell to lift the first cargoes.    Bynoe disputed that.  ,He said the government invited nine oil companies to present bids because crude from the Liza field was new to the market, and the government wanted to see how it performed in different refineries.  ,He declined to disclose the price included in Shell's winning bid. ,Latin American nations including Mexico and Ecuador have signed contracts with trading companies in recent years so the firms market a portion of their crude exports. Critics say that by doing so, the countries or their state-run firms can lose an opportunity to obtain better terms by dealing directly with refiners.  ,After finding more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources in Guyana, Exxon and its partners Hess Corp (,) and CNOOC Ltd (,) expect to produce 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude by 2025.  ,Several other firms - including Tullow Oil (,), Repsol SA (,) and Total SA (,) are also exploring off the coast, though none have yet made commercial finds. ,Bynoe said Guyana expects to hire a company within two months to conduct new seismic surveys in the shallow continental shelf and some in deeper waters to provide hints as to where else oil may lie. He later added that after the procurement was complete, the contract could still take some time to finalize.     ,That would set the stage for a new licensing round for offshore acreage around the second quarter of 2021, he said.         ,The government is also working on a new template for production-sharing agreements (PSA) that could apply to future offshore development, but Bynoe reiterated that Guyana has no plans to renegotiate the Exxon deal.      ,The opposition and outside observers have criticized the Exxon agreement, which includes a 2% royalty and 50% profit share after Exxon recovers its costs, as too generous. But the company and the government argue incentives were necessary to attract investment to a risky play.     ,Bynoe did not specify what could change with the new PSA, parts of which would need to be approved by Congress, but said Guyana's basin was a less risky play after Exxon's discovery, allowing the government to \"move from a position of greater knowledge.\"      ,He added that the country expected to hire an international consulting firm to help update its petroleum legislation, which was passed in 1986, by next week at the latest.\n",

However, that said, obviously outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from China has gone down considerably, but other cross border M&A remains reasonably strong.   ,Q - Many of Citigroup's competitors are going down market to look for growth since there is more competition for the biggest deals but fewer of them. Why hasn't Citi followed suit?   ,A - We are not going down market because we do not believe that's the right phraseology. What we are doing is spending significant time on smaller emerging growth companies, which we believe, over time, will be winners within their sub-sectors. ,Those companies are candidates for initial public offerings, merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities and other potential services that we can bring to bear as they grow globally.  ,Q - How has the era of \"unicorns\" changed the way Citigroup sources new clients?  ,A - The era of unicorns relates to the earlier question about covering smaller companies. The unicorn valuations help highlight companies with great potential for us to cover and are very helpful in the areas we should invest in from the people standpoint.  ,Q - In 2018, Citi's overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination rose to 5.1%, from 4.9%. How is the effort to capture more market share progressing and what are the biggest hurdles?   ,A - We continue to increase market share in 2019 slowly and carefully. The hurdles remain in retaining and attracting the best talent. This is a people business and we have to ensure that we have the best. ,Q - How will the corporate banking landscape change, given recent consolidation in the capital markets industry. Will fewer players in equity or debt impact the other corporate banking business lines?  ,A - Corporate banking business will remain a broad global business. Obviously the big 3 American corporate banks continue to enjoy a very strong position in the marketplace and remain very strong. But they (face) competition from leading banks in Asia and Europe.  ,In terms of fixed income and equities, some players have retreated to some extent and that has given other players the opportunity to pick up market share.             ,(This interview was conducted in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, a chat room hosted on the Eikon platform.

The group, which has so far signed up 16 insurers and pension funds with combined assets of almost $4 trillion, has pledged to align investments with the most ambitious Paris temperature targets. ,The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, last week announced an overhaul of the way it approaches climate risk. Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the \"strongest foundation\" for client portfolios. ,Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with $25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development.  ,\"This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition,\" David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters. ,Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number. ,Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager Schroders, said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be \"robust and logical\". ,\"There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work,\" he said. ,Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their \"carbon intensity\" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue. ,A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time. ,Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C. ,\"The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like,\" said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. ,The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores. ,The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers. ,Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer. ,\"A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits,\" said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI. ,\"You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future.\" ,Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years.  ,The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory. ,Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy. ,Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities.   ,Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as \"warming potentials\" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions. ,\"Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,\" said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month. ,The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz British rival Aviva and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C. ,AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C. ,\"The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?\" he said. \"We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down.\"\n",

While the deal has been forecast to create 176,000 U.S. jobs over 15 years, it is not expected to bring lost factory jobs back to the United States from Mexico in coming years.  ,The bill passed on Thursday is identical to the bill voted in by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, after swift approval by multiple Senate committees in recent days.  ,Here are some of the key changes to the pact:  ,One of the biggest changes requires increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region, to 75% from 62.5% under NAFTA, with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum. ,And 40-45% of a vehicle's value must come from \"high wage\" areas paying workers at least $16 an hour, namely the United States and Canada, a provision aimed at slowing the industry's migration to low-wage Mexico. Vehicles that fail to meet the standard will be subject to U.S. tariffs. ,The rules put some foreign-brand automakers in the United States at a disadvantage, by forcing them to invest in new U.S. or Canadian plants for high-value components such as engines and transmissions.  ,Canada will provide U.S. dairy farmers access to about 3.5 percent of its $16 billion annual domestic dairy market. In exchange, the United States backed off efforts to force Canada to scrap its longstanding \"supply management\" system, which maintains high dairy tariffs. ,The United States will be able to increase exports of some milk products like skim milk and milk proteins to Canada.  ,The United States also gets tariff-free access to Canada for 57,000 tonnes of chicken by year six of the deal, and access for 10 million dozen U.S. eggs and egg equivalents. ,To encourage Mexican workers to unionize and to drive up wages, the deal allows the United States and Canada to convene panels of international labor experts to hear complaints if  Mexican factories are denying them the freedom to organize and collectively bargain. ,If such violations are found and remedial actions are not taken, it allows the complaining country to rescind tariff-free access for the offending facility's products, among other penalties. ,COPYRIGHT, DIGITAL TRADE, E-COMMERCE ,Copyright protection will extend for 70 years past an author's death, in line with current U.S. law.

The increases will benefit online retailers shipping across the region's borders and small businesses importing small orders. ,The deal will phase out much of the old investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) protections, which gave North American firms operating in a neighboring country the option to challenge local government decisions at an international tribunal.  ,Under the new deal, the ISDS tribunal would only be an option for firms disputing the Mexican government over a small number of issues, such as state expropriation of assets or discrimination against foreign entities, and firms operating in a handful of industries.  ,The deal aims to hold down drug prices by limiting some patent protections for pharmaceuticals. Eliminated from the original text is a required 10-year data exclusivity period for biotech medicines, which U.S. Democrats feared would prolong higher prices for some of the priciest drugs. ,The deal also removes a provision that would require parties to confirm patents for new uses of known drugs, combating a process called \"patent evergreening\" that blocks generic competition. ,The deal does not include any provisions to limit climate change, disappointing environmental groups. ,But the changes require each of the three countries to adhere to the 1987 Montreal Protocol to eliminate ozone-depleting substances.  ,The text also requires compliance with international agreements on endangered species, wetlands, Antarctic marine life, whaling and tuna fisheries.\n",

After a number of lean years, Ericsson has been boosted by the roll-out of 5G, particularly in the United States, and analysts hope it can benefit from a U.S. campaign to shut out Chinese rival Huawei [HWT.UL] from supplying 5G equipment.   ,But while the new technology has helped sales, it has increased costs. Ericsson has also opted to take on major new clients to gain market share, betting a hit on margins in the short term will help to deliver longer-term profitability.  ,It recently bought the antenna and filter business of Germany's Kathrein to boost its 5G portfolio and said costs and investments related to the deal would weigh on margins in 2020. ,Increased investments in digitalization and more spending on  compliance - after a $1 billion payment to resolve probes by U.S. authorities into corruption - are also expected to mean somewhat higher operating costs in 2020. ,In October, rival Nokia (,) shocked investors by slashing its profit outlook for 2019 and 2020 and pausing dividend payments to allow for heavier investments in 5G, leading its shares to drop by a fifth.     ,However, Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm said the Swedish firm was on track to deliver its 2020 targets of an adjusted operating margin of over 10% and sales of 230-240 billion Swedish crowns.      ,The company also hiked its dividend by 50% to 1.50 crowns per share, which Christer Gardell, managing partner at Ericsson's top shareholder Cevian Capital, said showed its confidence in the future. ,\"We are convinced that Borje Ekholm will surpass the targets and show the doubters that they are wrong\", Gardell told Reuters.  ,Ericsson is fighting Nokia and Huawei to take the lead in the roll out of 5G networks, which are expected to host critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications. ,That has led the United States to blacklist Huawei and launch a worldwide campaign to try to persuade allies to ban it from their 5G networks, alleging its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - which Huawei denies. ,Britain is expected soon to make a final decision on whether to allow Huawei equipment in its 5G mobile networks, while Germany may also rule on the matter during the spring. ,North America has been the biggest market for 5G so far, boosting Ericsson's sales, but the company said demand slowed in the fourth quarter as the proposed merger between Sprint (,) and T-Mobile hit their spending.  ,\"It was a significant impact in a small part of the market which means the quarter came out negative in North America,\" Ekholm said. \"But in general demand is very strong there.\" ,While the United States is an early 5G adopter, China is expected to start its roll out this year. ,Ericsson, which has targeted market share in China, said it was still too early to assess possible volumes and price levels for deploying 5G there. ,\"We expect that the initial challenging margins will shift to positive margins over the lifespan of the contracts,\" it said. ,Western Europe is expected to lag behind, but by 2025 the GSMA telecoms industry lobby group estimates operators globally will have spent $1 trillion building up 5G networks, offering a huge jackpot for the leading suppliers. ,Ericsson's adjusted fourth-quarter operating earnings rose to 5.7 billion crowns ($600.2 million) from 2.6 billion a year earlier,  but were down from 7.4 billion the previous quarter.

It was the second 737 Max to crash in a matter of months. A Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia in October, 2018.  ,The expert panel, led by a retired Air Force general and a former head of the Air Lines Pilot Association, also called for improvements in how the FAA certifies new planes. It did not back ending the long-standing practice of delegating some certification tasks to aircraft manufacturers. ,The panel, which was named by U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in April, recommended the FAA mandate Safety Management Systems (SMS) for \"design and manufacturing organizations.\" The FAA currently requires them for airlines. ,The special committee report released on Thursday said \"unlike the current certification system's focus on compliance, SMSs foster a holistic assessment of whether the combinations of actions such as design, procedures, and training work together to counter potential hazards.\" ,Boeing's safety culture was harshly criticized last week after it released hundreds of internal messages about the development of the 737 MAX, including one that said the plane was \"designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\" ,Boeing in a statement said it \"will study these recommendations closely, as we continue to work with government and industry stakeholders to enhance the certification process.\" ,FAA Administrator Steve Dickson praised the recommendation to \"advance the use of Safety Management Systems throughout all sectors of the aviation industry,\" adding that the FAA will review the findings. ,U.S. House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio last month said his panel's review of the fatal crashes found \"a broken safety culture within Boeing and an FAA that was unknowing, unable or unwilling to step up, regulate, and provide appropriate oversight of Boeing.\" ,The special committee said new aircraft testing \"should include multiple failure mode scenarios and involve trained pilots who reflect a representation of the anticipated end-users of the product.\" ,National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt said in September that crews in the two fatal crashes \"did not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would.\" ,On the two planes that crashed, a sensor fed faulty data to a key safety system known as MCAS designed to prevent stalls that repeatedly activated, pushing the nose down. One of the software updates being implemented by Boeing will prevent the system from activating more than once before a situation has been resolved. ,The special committee said the FAA should propose to the International Civil Aviation Organization \"the sharing of operational data internationally to enhance safety.\" ,The report also said the FAA needs an \"aggressive recruitment campaign to encourage students to pursue careers at the FAA\" and should address \"concerns about potential undue pressure\" on Boeing employees conducting FAA certification tasks. ,The Justice Department and Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General are both investigating the 737 MAX certification.\n",

And that's okay. Because now they will.\" ,Trump also introduced hordes of guests who were not on the stage, commenting on everything from Boeing's troubles with its 737 MAX jet to his seeming regret over choosing Jerome Powell to be chairman of the Federal Reserve. ,To Kevin Warsh, who Trump also considered for the position, the president said: \"Why weren't you more forceful when you wanted that job? Why weren't you more forceful, Kevin? ... I would have been very happy with you.\"  ,To David Calhoun, the new chief executive of Boeing, Trump alluded, from the stage, to the crisis over the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March.  ,\"Stand up, David. See, he didn't want to stand.  Let me tell you: It's not your fault. You just got there. You'll straighten it out quickly, please,\" Trump said. ,\"We will,\" Calhoun replied from where he sat in the audience. ,Some 35 minutes into the ceremony, Trump returned to the Teleprompter. Roughly 50 minutes in, he passed the microphone to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who spoke briefly. ,When it came time to sign, Trump sat down at a table on the stage and motioned spontaneously for U.S. lawmakers in the room to come stand behind him. That prompted guests on the Chinese side, which cares deeply about protocol, to come up as well, crowding the stage and blocking the view. ,Once the ceremony was officially over, the music started up again.

His Conservative opposition wants more time to study the agreement.  ,The United States eliminated India's special trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences in June, affecting some $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States, amid a dispute over India's new digital trade restrictions.  ,Both governments had hoped to hammer out a limited trade deal in September, but negotiations fell apart over tariffs on U.S. farm products and approval schedules for Indian pharmaceuticals.  ,Discussions have heated up again ahead of Trump's expected visit to India in February. ,Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products, deferring a threat of higher U.S. car duties. ,The two countries are due to tackle the automotive issue in a second round of negotiations expected to start in April.  ,The United States and China are expected to start talks on thorny issues such as Chinese subsidies as part of a Phase 2 trade deal, after Washington agreed in December to roll back some tariffs in exchange for China's pledge to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years. ,Trade experts are skeptical that any agreement will occur before the U.S. presidential election in November.\n",

How has that changed from last year? ,A - In the last three months, we've been shifting more into macro strategies and picked up a bit of long bias. We believe that momentum in the market is still there as a result of the Fed moves.  ,Q -  Who do you think would be the best candidate to beat President Trump in this year's election?  ,A - Mike Bloomberg - with his money, operational forces, and ground game - could probably beat Trump. Bernie (Sanders) or Elizabeth (Warren) would get demolished.  ,Trump is likely to get re-elected. The one person who could defeat him would be Trump.  ,We are 300 days out from the election.

The answer to that right now is yes. And if that is the case that puts a floor on the value of the aircraft,\" he said. ,He acknowledged banks may insist on lower loan-to-value ratios on loans issued against the MAX than against rival Airbus planes.  ,Kelly said he would expect Boeing to compensate it if it is forced to take back leases and lease the plane to new airlines. Any costs due to the grounding or any fall in the planes value would also feed into talks on compensation, he said.  ,\"We would expect Boeing shareholders to absorb that pain because its their fault not our shareholders,\" he said.\n",

New aircraft typically take 6-7 years or more to bring to market once a decision is made, though Boeing aims to shorten that in part through digital technology and new business models designed around the NMA. ,Calhoun \"has asked the team to do an assessment of the future market and what kind of airplane is needed to meet the future market,\" spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. ,Noting that the original assessments on the NMA were made about two and a half years ago, he said the new study would \"build upon what has been learned ... in design and production.\"  ,In further evidence of a change of pace, people familiar with the matter said a meeting between Boeing and a major potential supplier, originally scheduled for next week, had been abruptly canceled with no new date set.   ,That contrasts with the approach just weeks ago when Boeing was still presenting new details of the NMA to some airlines, including a working logo - \"theNMA\" - and details of an \"advanced composite\" structure, according to a slide seen by Reuters. ,The NMA had been designed to address a slender gap between single-aisle workhorse jets like the 737 MAX and long-haul wide-body jets like the 787.  ,But most of the effort revolved around a new production system designed not only to support the NMA but to lay the groundwork for the next single-aisle aircraft after the 737 MAX. ,Calhoun said he expected the MAX, whose return to service was delayed again earlier this week, to resume its previous place in the market and remain in service for a generation. ,Traditionally toe-to toe-with Europe's Airbus SE (,), Boeing has fallen behind in sales for the largest category of single-aisle planes, such as the 200-240-seat Airbus A321neo, which overlaps with the niche being targeted by the NMA. ,By delaying a decision on the NMA, Boeing already risked losing the sweetest part of the market, especially after Airbus seized contracts with two major U.S. airlines, analysts said. ,Analysts have also questioned whether Boeing, facing costs equivalent to a new program to repair the MAX crisis, as well as delays on its large new 777X jet whose maiden flight is set for Friday, would have appetite for such a costly project now.\n",

However, the deal so far is not comprehensive enough to significantly boost economic momentum,\" said Janwillem Acket, chief economist at Julius Baer. ,That was also clear from predictions for the Federal Reserve to remain on the sidelines this year and on expectations the next likely move would be a cut rather than a hike. ,\"It is almost a one-way bet on the Fed right now, that either they are on hold or they are easing this year. I mean there is virtually no chance of tightening,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities. ,Reuters polls over the past couple of years have repeatedly pointed to the U.S.-China trade war as the prominent downside risk for the American economy and warned it would bring the next recession closer. ,Now, despite a signed trade agreement, albeit a partial one, the chances of a U.S. recession were similar to predictions in recent months - around 20-25% in the next 12 months and about 30-35% in the next two years. ,\"Recession odds, which we peg at roughly one-in-four in 2020, will wax and wane with developments on the trade war front,\" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO. ,\"While recent progress is encouraging, we remain skeptical that a broad accord can be reached this year as complex issues, such as state industry subsidies and forced technology transfers, still need to be resolved.\" ,All 53 respondents polled said the latest deal would either \"reduce the downside risk to the U.S. economy\" or \"help U.S. economic growth moderately.\" Not a single economist said it would \"significantly boost growth.\"   ,Reuters poll graphic on the U.S. economic outlook , ,The U.S. economy will coast with annualized growth expected to have barely moved from the latest reported rate of 2.1% at the end of the forecast horizon - the second quarter of 2021. ,\"The growth slowdown has probably troughed, but we do not anticipate a V-shaped recovery,\" noted Kevin Loane, senior economist at Fathom Consulting. ,While the schism in forecasters' views was clear, with 28 respondents saying the risks to their growth forecasts were skewed more to the upside and 22 seeing downside risks, most economists agreed any significant boost was unlikely. ,That was largely attributed to several other events which could prove disrupting - including a period of uncertainty in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. ,\"Our views for 2020 are upbeat but cautious. A rebound from last year's global manufacturing and trade slump is likely, but businesses will be hesitant to invest amid a host of ongoing uncertainties,\" said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. ,With little change expected in the inflation outlook compared to recent months, all 105 economists polled forecast the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75% when it meets Jan. 28-29. ,The Fed was forecast to extend that pause through to the end of 2021 at least, with the probability of a rate cut this year seen at 30%. ,While there was a clear sense of near-term optimism among economists compared with last year, nearly 75% of respondents forecast growth to be below the latest reported rate of 2.1% by mid-2021, up from around 60% in December. ,\"The (trade) deal may encourage some business investment in the near-term, but the deal is only a temporary and unstable equilibrium. It is very likely to break down, and that would undermine confidence again. So any boost to economic growth will be short-lived,\" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank. ,Reuters poll graphic on U.S. recession probability ,\n",

My expectation is that we'll start conversations on phase two in the near future,\"     he said in an interview at the end of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. ,China had a low-key presence at the Davos meeting, with most of the focus on trade concentrated on a dispute between the United States and the European Union over a \"digital tax\", with Washington threatening retaliation if the bloc's members tax U.S. based companies before an apparent compromise was reached. ,\"Once there is a consensus, those tax changes need to be implemented and in many places, require legislation. We object to a tax that targets just American companies,\" Mnuchin said. ,With chief executives representing many of the biggest companies from around the world at Davos, it is often used as a barometer of business confidence and the economic outlook. ,\"It seems like Europe and Asia have bottomed and the U.S. still looks in very good shape. So there's a lot of positive attitudes,\" Mnuchin said, with U.S. tax cuts in prospect. ,\"My expectation is that the focus of tax cuts will be for the middle class and some pro-growth incentives,\" he added. ,The biggest battleground during the four-day event has been the debate over how politicians and business leaders should tackle climate change, with much of the focus on exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and activist Greta Thunberg. ,This year's WEF included a contingent of young activists like Thunberg, with the organisers keen to add to the voices engaging in debate at the exclusive event. ,\"I was at dinner last night and people were very focused on the climate issue. My comment was, look we're in the middle of a serious health issue in China. It was not a topic of discussion until I brought it up,\" Mnuchin said.  ,\"The environment is important. I just think it should be put in context. This goes back to a little bit of communication. The youth have focused on this one issue.  But there are many other important issues that will impact the next generation.\"  ,One possibility, Mnuchin said, was to change the lexicon. ,\"Perhaps the historical language that we use, we need to reconsider. When young people hear capitalism, perhaps it has a different meaning to them,\" Mnuchin said. ,\"Perhaps the language we should be using is free markets versus managed markets. Open society versus closed society.\" ,Addressing the use of sanctions by the United States, Mnuchin said it was a strategy that needed scrutiny because of the potential impact it could have on the U.S. dollar. ,\"Sanctions are up dramatically. Over a very long period of time, we have to be careful in how we use these, where it could impact the use of the dollar. So we take that responsibility very seriously,\" he said. ,Mnuchin is also looking at increasing the amount of U.S. borrowing at longer maturities, with a focus on 20 years. ,\"We can issue a lot more 20-year bonds than we could issue 50- and 100-year bonds. So in terms of our objective in both raising proceeds and extending duration, the 20-year bond is a priority at the moment,\" he said.\n",

Calhoun said Wednesday he did not see those as \"serious problems.\" ,The FAA added Friday that \"safety is the top priority, and the FAA continues to work with other safety regulators to ensure that Boeing has addressed all known issues with the aircraft. ,FAA approval before mid-year could happen only if Boeing continues to make complete and thorough submissions, an official told Reuters, and emphasized that unforeseen issues could always potentially delay approval. ,American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines Co have all pushed back the resumption of MAX flights until early June and indicated this week that the return could be delayed further if FAA approval does not happen until mid-year. ,Airlines have said they will need at least 30 days after the FAA grants approval for pilot training, software updates and required maintenance. ,Calhoun said Wednesday that the mid-year timetable came after the planemaker endorsed a plan for pilots to do simulator training before they resume flying the MAX.  ,Meanwhile, Boeing's attempt on Friday to launch the maiden flight of its 777X - the world's largest twin-engined jetliner - in Seattle was delayed because of inclement weather.

Hourly rates for simulator training can cost $500 to $1,000, it said.  ,High demand for 737 MAX simulators has led the Montreal-company and its rival TRU to produce simulators for customers they have yet to line up. ,\"Customers are making increasing inquiries from all over the globe,\" a TRU spokeswoman said. ,South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet, which does not have a 737 MAX simulator, said it had already contacted Boeing, other airlines and training centers. ,\"With limited MAX simulators available, we expect carriers will likely face challenges to book slots for MAX simulators,\" said an Eastar official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. ,Fiji Airways spent more than $10 million to buy a 737 MAX simulator to help save on the costs and lost productivity of sending pilots to Singapore, Australia and the United States for training, said its chief operating officer, Paul Doherty. ,The carrier uses its simulator 35% to 42% of the available hours to train its 70 737 pilots and had plans to sell the additional time. Now it is getting calls from airlines thousands of miles away.  ,\"We have got interest ... particularly from Asia,\" Doherty said. \"We are expecting some from the U.S. Our focus is to really develop our own pilots and to provide the best for Fiji Airways, but we are also very happy to help other airlines that need some time.

            "Rank 143: Similarity 0.438670814037323 - FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank launched a broad review of its policy on Thursday that is likely to see new President Christine Lagarde redefine the ECB's main goal and how to achieve it. ,The euro zone's central bank has fallen short of its inflation target of just under 2% for years, even after launching increasingly aggressive stimulus measures under Lagarde's predecessor, Mario Draghi.  ,Lagarde said that aim will now be reviewed, along with the ECB's toolkit, how it measures price growth and how it communicates with the public.  ,\"We will not leave any stone unturned and how we measure inflation is clearly something we need to look at,\" Lagarde told her second news conference as ECB president. ,How the ECB changes its formulation of price stability — currently defined as an annual inflation rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term — will be crucial to anticipate future policy moves. ,The ECB could signal its commitment to boosting inflation by raising the goal to 2% and spelling out that it will take any undershooting just as seriously as an overshoot. ,But hawks on the policymaking Governing Council, who have long called for the ECB's money taps to be shut off, will not go down without a fight. ,Some of them favour creating a tolerance band around 2%, which would reduce pressure on the ECB to act, while others would leave the target unchanged or even cut it. ,Lagarde refrained from revealing her favoured option pending the end of the review, expected in November or December. ,An analysis on how to better incorporate housing costs, which have been rising fast in Germany and other euro zone countries, is likely to take even longer, Lagarde added. ,The ECB will also look closely at how it can incorporate the economic impact of climate change into its policy. ,This is a thorny issue that some of Lagarde's colleagues do not believe belongs in a central bank's mandate at all. ,Objections include that a climate change objective might interfere with the ECB's goal of maintaining price stability or ease pressure on governments to do their part. ,\"I'm aware of all that but I'm also aware of the danger of doing nothing and I think that, you know, failing to try is already failing,\" Lagarde said. ,She added the ECB could look at whether the issuers of the bonds that it buys or accepts as collateral comply with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) criteria. ,ECB rate-setters did not make any policy change on Thursday, simply standing by their pledge to keep buying bonds and, if needed, cut interest rates until price growth in the euro zone heads back to their goal. ,They did, however, discuss the recent improvement in the economic outlook, which has seen data stabilise and the United States and China reach a trade deal. ,Lagarde acknowledged that views differed on the Governing Council and welcomed the discussion, emphasising the diplomatic skills that her predecessor was often accused of lacking. ,\"I'm not a despotic president of the Governing Council,\" Lagarde said. \"All governors have their space and time in order to share their perspective and submit their views, but at the end of the day and at the end of the process, we still have to complete the introductory statement and release a monetary policy decision.\" ,The ECB is widely expected to leave its monetary policy on hold until the review is completed.  ,That would leave it adding 20 billion euros ($22.16 billion) worth of bonds to its 2.6 trillion euro portfolio every month and charging banks 0.5% on their idle cash for most of the year.   ,But Lagarde said the ECB would adhere to its current strategy until a new one is adopted, meaning policy changes could still take place in the meantime. ,\"We think the ECB will cut interest rates at the end of the year when the review concludes, in order to underline its commitment to meeting the inflation target,\" said Paul Diggle, an economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  ,The euro , fell against the U.S. dollar after Lagarde's news conference and was last down 0.4% at $1.1046.\n",

Two earlier attempts were called off this week due to high winds. ,Boeing officials said the maiden voyage would herald months of testing and certification before the aircraft enters service with Emirates in 2021, a year later than originally scheduled because of snags during development. ,The aircraft is the larger of two versions planned by Boeing and will officially be known as the 777-9, but is better known under its development codename, the 777X. ,Its most visible features include folding wingtips - designed to allow its large new carbon-composite wings to fit into the same parking bays as earlier models - and the world's largest commercial engines, built by General Electric and wide enough to swallow the fuselage of a 737 MAX. ,The successful flight was a boost for Boeing as it grapples with a broadening crisis over the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes. ,\"To me this is the flagship for the big airlines around the world ... it represents the great things we can do as a company,\" 777X marketing director Wendy Sowers told reporters when asked about the flight's importance in light of the MAX crisis. ,Boeing says it has sold 309 of the aircraft – worth more than $442 million each at list prices – but analysts have questioned its heavy reliance on Middle East carriers that have scaled back purchases as they suffer a pause in their expansion. ,The 777X will compete with the recently introduced Airbus A350-1000 which seats about 360 passengers. Both reflect the growing range and efficiency of twin-engined jets that are steadily displacing their older four-engined counterparts. ,The two planemakers have clashed over the relative efficiency of their latest jets but both face worries about demand due to overcapacity and signs of weakness in the global economy.\n",

U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell on rising worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China. ,Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report.  ,The four-week moving average of claims dropped 12,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some pickup in job growth this month. ,The economy created 145,000 jobs last month after adding a massive 256,000 positions in November. The slowdown in job growth has been blamed on a shortage of workers and ebbing demand in some industries like manufacturing, which has been hammered by trade tensions and problems at Boeing (,). ,Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, with ripple effects down the supply chain. Boeing's biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (,) said early this month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base.  ,Despite the low level of claims, the data have been showing layoffs in manufacturing, as well as transportation and warehousing, construction, educational service and accommodation and food services industries from late 2019 through mid-January.  ,That fits in with the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which last week showed \"most districts cited widespread labor shortages as a factor constraining job growth,\" and \"a number of districts reported job cuts or reduced hiring among manufacturers,\" as well as \"scattered reports of job cuts in the transportation and energy sectors,\" at the tail end of 2019. ,\"The jury is out on whether this signals a soft patch for the monthly payroll figures in January,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ,Despite the moderation in job gains, the labor market remains on solid footing, with the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5% in December and a measure of labor market slack dropping to an all-time low of 6.7%. ,Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 37,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Jan. 11. The so-called continuing claims had surged to 1.80 million at the end of 2019, which was the highest level since April 2018. The jump was blamed on year-end volatility. ,The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims increased 2,000 to 1.76 million in the most recent week.\n",

But, we continue to incur financial damages in 2020, and we will continue discussions with Boeing regarding further compensation,\" CEO Gary Kelly said. ,Southwest has estimated a $828 million hit to operating profit from the MAX groundings in 2019.

Renewed housing market momentum could soften some of the hit on the economy from manufacturing as the thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions is offset by Boeing's (,) suspension this month of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane. ,\"The previous weak link, housing, is coming back, but the current laggard, manufacturing, is slowing further,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ,Existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018, boosted by a surge in sales of multi-family housing units and gains in single-family home dwellings.

Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500.  ,Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said. ,Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later. ,Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July.

It set new records for annual profit and revenue, and met or exceeded full-year performance targets Gorman laid out last January. ,Since taking over a decade ago, the 61-year-old CEO has transformed Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank.

Over the long-term, he is hoping the bank can get to 70% or less. ,That metric, which measures costs relative to revenue, is watched closely by investors as a symbol of whether a company spends wisely. Morgan Stanley met its prior goal of 73% or less in 2019. ,Keeping costs under control will help the bank reach another metric Gorman set for returns on equity (ROE), which shows how profitably a bank uses shareholder funds. ,Morgan Stanley now aims to produce ROE of 13-15% through 2022, and 15-17% after that. Its 11.7% ROE last year was within Gorman's prior targeted range of 10-13%. ,Finally, he now wants the wealth unit to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 28-30% over the next two years, and 30% or more after that. The business's 27.2% margin last year was comfortably within the prior goal of 26-28%. ,On the call, some analysts probed the assumptions behind those figures, asking what might happen if markets collapse. On the other hand, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo - who has repeatedly pressed management to raise targets - asked why they should not be higher. ,Gorman recalled a time when analysts were skeptical that Morgan Stanley could achieve much lower goals he had set, when its ROE was just 2-4% and its wealth margins were only 10%. He compared them to children in the back of a car asking, \"When are we going to get there?\" ,\"What I've always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances,\" he said. \"The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty.\" ,Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report results this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (,), Citigroup Inc (,) and Bank of America Corp (,) posting similar trends in their Wall Street businesses. ,However, its performance came in a stark contrast to its closest rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (,), which reported a profit decline on Thursday.

            "Rank 197: Similarity 0.33179396390914917 - NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose about 1% on Thursday, as progress on another major trade deal fed optimism that energy demand will grow in 2020, which offset bearish market comments from the International Energy Agency.  ,The U.S. Senate approved a revamp of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement a day after the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal between the United States and China. ,Brent LCOc1 settled up 62 cents, or 1%, to $64.62 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose by 71 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.52 a barrel. ,The deal that the Senate approved was a revamp of the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. A day earlier, U.S. and Chinese leaders signed the Phase 1 trade deal calling for the world's largest energy importer to buy $50 billion more of U.S. oil, liquefied natural gas and other energy products over two years. ,However, analysts warned that China might struggle to meet the target and said oil prices could be volatile until more details emerge. ,Trade sources said sharply higher Chinese purchases of U.S. energy products as part of the China-U.S. trade deal will shake up global crude oil trade flows if American supplies squeeze rival crudes out of the top oil import market. ,\"We had the U.S-China trade deal yesterday - signed and sealed.

            "Rank 200: Similarity 0.2866503894329071 - WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased for a third straight month in December, with households buying a range of goods even as they cut back on purchases of motor vehicles, suggesting the economy maintained a moderate growth pace at the end of 2019. ,Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped for a fifth straight week last week, indicating the labor market remained strong despite a recent slowdown in job growth. That should help sustain consumer spending and probably keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track.  ,The Federal Reserve on Wednesday described the economy as having continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019. The U.S. central bank has signaled that it could keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year after reducing borrowing costs three times in 2019. ,\"There's more fuel in the tank of this economic expansion,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  ,The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for November was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.3% instead of rising 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.3% in December. Compared to December of last year, retail sales accelerated 5.8%. Sales increased 3.6% in 2019.  ,Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5% last month after falling by a downwardly revised 0.1% in November. ,The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have edged up 0.1% in November. Core retail sales for October were also revised lower. ,Overall sales rose in December despite retailers such as Target Corp (,), Kohl's (,), J.C. Penney (,) and Macy's (,) reporting a decline in sales for the holiday period as foot traffic in malls dropped. ,Though a report last week showed a slowdown in job growth in December and the increase in the annual wage gain retreating to below 3.0%, the labor market remains on solid footing. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Jan. 11. ,Economists had forecast claims would rise to 216,000 in the latest week. ,The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 , index crossing the 3,300 threshold for the first time, as upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley (,) and a tech rally added to optimism from an initial U.S.-China trade deal. ,While claims are trending lower, there are some worrying signs emerging. The claims data showed layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, construction, educational services and accommodation and food services industries in late 2019 and early 2020. ,Some of the job losses in manufacturing, which were spread across at least eight states, could be related to the 18-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a \"Phase 1\" trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing the trade war. ,But with U.S. duties remaining in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total, economists do not expect the initial deal to provide a boost to manufacturing, which is in recession. ,A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in January, with manufacturers reporting receiving more orders. But a measure of unfilled orders at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware contracted and manufacturers cut hours for employees.  ,Even as trade tensions have eased, a pall remains over manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. Boeing (,) has suspended production of its fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner starting this month and ripple effects are already being felt, with a major supplier announcing layoffs last week. ,\"Manufacturing will grow at a subdued pace in 2020, constrained by slower external and domestic growth as well as ongoing uncertainty on the trade policy front despite the Phase-one trade deal,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ,For now, consumers appear set to continue driving the economy, also thanks to house prices and a bullish stock market. ,Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the third quarter. Given the downward revisions to October and November core retail sales, growth in consumer spending is expected to have slowed to around or below a 2.5% rate in the fourth quarter.  ,Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are as high as a 2.5% rate, in part because of a drop in imports, which compressed the trade deficit. The economy expanded at a 2.1% pace in the July-September period.  ,In December, auto sales fell 1.3%, the biggest drop since last January, after increasing 1.5% in November. Higher gasoline prices lifted receipts at service stations, which jumped 2.8%. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.2% after being unchanged in November. ,Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 0.6% in December. Receipts at building material stores surged 1.4% and sales at clothing stores accelerated 1.6%. Spending at furniture stores edged up 0.1%. Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars, with sales rising 0.2% last month. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 0.9%.\n"

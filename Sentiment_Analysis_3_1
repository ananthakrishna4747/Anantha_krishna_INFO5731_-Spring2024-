Through a petition for writ of error coram nobis (establishing that the case was premised on errors of fact withheld from the judge and the defense by the prosecution), the legal team reopened the case, provided evidence that the factual underpinnings to the exclusion orders were fraudulent, and successfully had the Korematsu conviction vacated, as well as a handful of other similar convictions.

Her father had come to Hawai'i from Hiroshima in the mid-1910s as a contract worker on a pineapple plantation. He grew vegetables and kept chickens around the house to help feed the family. Her mother cooked Japanese food only in part because meat was hard to come by. Many of their co-workers on the plantation were Japanese, and Yuriko used to go to the after-school school at Hongan-ji with these co-workers' children. Her peers at the public school included Filipinos, Chinese, Polynesians, Portuguese, and Haoles. When she was ten years old, her uncle and aunt in Los Angeles, who had been successful owners of Olympic Hotel, took her to Japan. They were childless, so their plan was to make Yuriko the family's heir. Yuriko quickly adjusted to the life in Japan and graduated from high school. She was working in an airplane factory when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Although she was not injured, she was irradiated because she walked through the city on the day after to look for her aunt and uncle. The entire city was still on fire. She saw many corpses and people with severe nuclear burns. She lost one of her uncles to the bomb. She also visited her friend working at an orphanage, and was struck by how many children had lost their parents to the bomb. In 1948, she went to Hawai'i to see her parents, thanks to the arrangement made by her brother who had come to Japan as part of the US occupation force. She decided that she did not want to go back to Hiroshima where memories of the destruction ""depressed"" her. She studied to regain her English and worked at her sister's bakery near Kahoku. She married a baker, and they became successful owners of another bakery named after their oldest son. Yuriko was somewhat worried about radiation effect when she was pregnant with her first child.

They raised grapes on three farms that Matsuko's father and his brother had bought. She remembers her father's affection for the family and his dedication to Buddhism, and how busy her mother was raising children. They hired Mexican laborers and operated their business successfully, winning many blue ribbons for their products at state fairs. Matsuko recalls how the family enjoyed going to camping at Yosemite, and how she went to a Japanese school on Saturdays and Sundays, which she found not effective in teaching her Japanese. As for the American school that she attended on weekdays, she recalls how her teachers were prejudiced against the Japanese. When she went to Japan in 1940, she felt her Japanese classmates were biased against Americans like herself. She and other Nisei at her school in Hiroshima spoke in English, making their Japanese classmate believe that the American students were bad-mouthing their Japanese peers. On August 8, 1945, she was injured and lost consciousness after the bombing, but she survived with the help of her Nisei friend that she knew from a sewing school she had attended in Hiroshima. She lost one of her sisters to the bombing, whom her family was able to identify only because of the white nametag she wore. After losing her Japanese husband to the war, Matsuko came back to the United States in 1947, went to a drapery school and worked in Hollywood as a dressmaker, and was remarried to a Nisei who had been a ""no-no-boy"" in Tule Lake and expressed no concern about the fact that Matsuko is a survivor. As a dedicated Buddhist, Matsuko spent her married life focusing on raising family and working at a nursery, and interacted with other US survivors only occasionally. She feels that being attacked by the bomb was like being hit by tsunami; it was shikata ga nai (It couldn't be helped).",https://ddr.densho.org/ddr-densho-1021-4/,https://ddr.densho.org/media/cache/2e/45/2e458c42149c4de725a16fb7d46eafd4.jpg,3-Jun-12.,"San Jose, California.",1:23:29,—,https://archive.org/download/ddr-densho-1021-4-1/ddr-densho-1021-4-1-mezzanine-b8f1186525.mp3,Positive

At the outbreak of World War II, he was one of only a handful of individuals to challenge the curfew and removal orders being enforced against Japanese on the West Coast, citing ""Christian principles,"" and asserting ""a duty to maintain the democratic standards for which this nation lives."" He turned himself in to the FBI, was found guilty, and served time for violating the curfew order, and failing to report for ""evacuation."" While serving time for this conviction, Gordon was served with a draft notice and again, refused to comply. He subsequently served another period of time as a draft resister. In 1943 the Supreme Court upheld his convictions. Some forty years postwar, in 1986, his case was reopened and his convictions surrounding the incarceration were vacated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that, ""racial bias was the cornerstone of the internment orders.""",https://ddr.densho.org/ddr-densho-1012-9/,https://ddr.densho.org/media/cache/83/05/8305cc81d3ae12c32a4533196fc603ed.jpg,"December 3, 1983.","San Francisco, California.",00:26:08,—,https://archive.org/download/ddr-densho-1012-9-1/ddr-densho-1012-9-1-mezzanine-719d1308d6.mp4,Negative

Born in Seattle on January 30, 1915, and attended Washington grade school, Garfield High School and the University of Washington. He grew up as a typical Nisei, working summers in Alaska salmon canneries and Western Avenue produce brokerages to pay for his education. He became interested in writing at Garfield where he was sports editor of the school paper. While attending the University he worked at the weekly Japanese American Courier published by the late Jimmie Sakamoto. A faculty adviser at the University urged Hosokawa to drop out of the journalism school ""because no newspaper in the country would hire a Japanese boy."" Hosokawa rejected the advice, but when he graduated in 1937 he found the professor was right. After working as a male secretary writing letters, Hosokawa and his bride, the former Alice Miyake of Portland, Oregon, went to Singapore in 1938 to help launch an English language daily. A year and a half later Hosokawa moved to Shanghai to work on an American-owned monthly magazine, the Far Eastern Review. Then, sensing the inevitability of war, he returned to Seattle in 1941 just five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. When war came, Hosokawa served as executive director of Seattle JACL's Emergency Defense Council helping people in the community to cope. He and his family were removed to the Puyallup Assembly Center, Washington. When other Seattleites were moved to Minidoka concentration camp, Idaho, Hosokawa and his wife and infant son were sent to Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Later, he learned he had been separated from his Seattle friends because he was considered a potential troublemaker. He was in Heart Mountain for 14 months, working as editor of the camp newspaper, the Heart Mountain Sentinel, before being released to join the Des Moines, Iowa Register in 1943. In 1946 he moved to Denver to work on the Denver Post. In 38 years at The Post he held such assignments as executive news editor, assistant managing editor and Sunday editor. He covered the Japanese peace treaty in San Francisco in 1951, the Summit meeting in Paris in 1960 and the Zengakuren student riots in Japan that same year. He also had assignments as war correspondent in Korea and Vietnam, and for 17 years was editor of Empire, the Post's prize-winning Sunday magazine. For his last seven years at the Post Hosokawa was editor of the editorial page -- a Japanese American imprisoned during World War II as a potential security risk who now directed the opinion section of a major American newspaper. After retiring from the Post in 1984 he served the Rocky Mountain News as ombudsman columnist for seven years. Hosokawa has taught journalism classes at the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado and University of Wyoming. He wrote a weekly comment column called ""From the Frying Pan"" in JACL's weekly Pacific Citizen from 1942 until 1999. Among other honors, Hosokawa is a former president of the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors and a member of that organization's Hall of Fame, a charter member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame. He was named JACL's Nisei of the Biennium in 1958, and has published 12 books.

Ray reflected on organized efforts at time, such as Initiative 200 to end affirmative action, and opposition against the gay and lesbian community. JACL was beginning to find new paths as a civil rights organization, such as collaborating and supporting the American Jewish Committee and the LGBTQIA community. The JACL membership was the powerful force then as it is today to rally the community on issues that impact everyone. JACL started to move beyond the focus on redress to work with other racial and ethnic communities and took the work to a new level, with younger leaders taking on leadership roles. As he and his family are Seattle natives, he expressed hope and gratitude for the recent work of JACL to support Black Lives Matter and on immigration issues. His work on the Pike Place Market Council and the progress seen in the area of minority and women owned businesses demonstrates how much impact volunteer work can have to make positive change.

As a Shin Issei immigrant born in Japan (in 1927) and trained in medicine in both Japan and the United States, Noguchi faced racial prejudice especially early in his career, leading to a dismissal from the position in 1969. The Japanese American community and organizations, including the Japanese American Citizens League, made a concerted effort to reinstate him, a campaign that proved successful. Noguchi felt ""grateful,"" and when US survivors ask for his assistance to organize themselves in 1970, he felt as if it was a good opportunity to give back to the community. He enlisted support for US hibakusha from the California State Senator Mervyn Dymally and the U.S. Congressman Edward Roybal. They authored the bills that would have established a publicly funded program for medical care and treatment of radiation illnesses among US survivors. Although both the state and federal bills failed, Noguchi's collaborative effort with the politicians of color reveal changing racial and class relations in the state and national politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The youngest of five children, Sarashina grew up surrounded by temple members (mostly plantation workers) and their families who enjoyed community picnics and samurai films. When his mother took her children to her hometown of Hiroshima in 1936, Sarashina struggled with Japanese at first. But soon, he got used to things Japanese thanks to the accommodations made by his mother, siblings, and schoolteachers. His older sisters baked Western style cakes and cookies and offered them to Sarashina's schoolmates, helping him to become better accepted. After the Pacific War began, Sarashina's family lost touch with his father who was still in Hawai'i. Later, he learned that his father had been taken by the FBI immediately after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He was sent to the US mainland, then to a number of different incarceration camps. Sarashina as a junior high school student was mobilized to work at an ammunition factory when the nuclear bomb struck Hiroshima. Although he was not injured, he was irradiated as he entered the city to return home. Sarashina suffered diarrhea and could not eat afterward. When he went back to Hawai'i in 1949, he attended high school again to relearn English. Soon, he found a job at a local radio station in Honolulu. During the Korean War, he volunteered to serve as a military intelligence officer. When he was sent to Korea, he was assigned to a unit led by a judo teacher he knew from Sawtelle, California. The teacher had been his older brother's schoolmate in Hiroshima, and so he took Sarashina under his wing throughout Sarashina's stay in Korea. Although Sarashina says that the American government could do more to support US hibakusha, he also says that he supports the medical checkups offered to American survivors by the Japanese government. In fact, he assisted the establishment of the checkup system in the early 1970s and continued to help the US hibakusha's organization called the American Society of Hiroshima-Nagasaki A-bomb Survivors. He takes pride in assisting many US survivors to obtain Japanese hibakusha techo (certificate of survivorhood) and to receive benefits.",https://ddr.densho.org/ddr-densho-1021-5/,https://ddr.densho.org/media/cache/20/5f/205fa3a76b0f11b694a4e5d1bfbb38de.jpg,6-Jun-12.,"San Jose, California.",2:42:23,—,https://archive.org/download/ddr-densho-1021-5-1/ddr-densho-1021-5-1-mezzanine-ec9df4a5e1.mp3,Positive

Satoh's extended family included an uncle who had studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his wife, a US-born Nikkei from Hawai'i who occasionally had received a ""care pack from the United States"" that she shared with the Satohs. Although the couple was not affected by the bomb as they were in Tokyo, one of Satoh's other aunts who was in Hiroshima died of radiation sickness. Satoh himself, too, was in Hiroshima as his family's house in Osaka was burned in an air raid early in 1945. Living in his relative's house in Koi, which was about six kilometer from the hypocenter, Satoh remembers hearing a ""real big sound"" at the moment of the explosion. His family decided to take refuge in his grandmother's house in the countryside, and as they walked through Hiroshima, they witnessed people dying on the street from severe burns and injuries. Many years later, his mother died of leukemia, while Satoh himself suffered from thyroid cancer. Immediately after the war, though, Satoh recalled only silence around the bomb, even as many of his classmates passed away because of the delayed radiation effect. He came to the United States in 1960 to study chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He married a Polish American woman who was his classmate, and experienced racial discrimination in the era when interracial marriages were still illegal in many US states. Satoh also found that his brother-in-law had worked as a maintenance crew for Enola Gay, the airplane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. Satoh worked as a chemist in the for-profit sector, and he occasionally lectured at colleges on applied chemistry. Although he was not part of any US survivors' groups, he was interested in issues of nuclear weaponry and bomb victims. He has assisted research for a book written by his acquaintance about US prisoners of war who died of the bomb in Hiroshima in 1945.",https://ddr.densho.org/ddr-densho-1021-9/,https://ddr.densho.org/media/cache/17/46/1746d896c74ef660891f1ba3b3dd75ff.jpg,23-Aug-15.,"East Lansing, Michigan.",2:09:44,—,https://archive.org/download/ddr-densho-1021-9-1/ddr-densho-1021-9-1-mezzanine-4899f812fb.mp3,Positive

After returning to Hiroshima to see his ailing father, Keiko's father found it impossible to return to America as his mother hid his passport to keep him in Japan. Shortly, Keiko's mother joined him in Hiroshima, also her hometown. Unlike her eight older siblings, then, Keiko was born in Japan, in 1936. She recalls the challenge of being sent to the countryside at the age of eight as part of shudan sokai, a wartime program for children aiming to protect the youth from fire bombings in cities. The food shortage and black market called yamiichi that flourished after the war, too, left Keiko a strong impression. She is a nyushi survivor, as she was exposed to radiation by walking through the city of Hiroshima three days after the bombing. She lost one of her older sisters to the bomb. She came to the United States in 1960 with a help of her US-born brother, by then living in Los Angeles. She relearned English from her father who was also back in the United States and in the area at that time. Keiko attended a technical college to study design while working as a ""schoolgirl"" and worked briefly in Beverly Hills as a dressmaker before she married Nisei from Stockton. A former prisoner of the Gila River War Relocation Center, he worked as a mechanic at Chevrolet after the war and became an owner of a car repair shop. Keiko helped the shop's book keeping, while she also raised two children and worked at a grocery store in order to pay for her health insurance. At the time of the interview, Keiko had just joined a biannual medical checkup conducted by Hiroshima physicians in San Francisco for the first time because of the encouragement by another US survivor. After her husband passed away in 1998, she has been enjoying talking with her children, going to a Buddhist church in Stockton, and keeping in touch with her Nisei friends.",https://ddr.densho.org/ddr-densho-1021-3/,https://ddr.densho.org/media/cache/98/18/98186401bfad01d9ecd1e23f7ec8f3f1.jpg,25-Jul-11.,"Stockton, California.",1:38:22,—,https://archive.org/download/ddr-densho-1021-3-1/ddr-densho-1021-3-1-mezzanine-701b9f69a1.mp3,Positive

Yamaguchi calls her father an ""assimilationist"" who mostly associated with non-Asians, and she feels that she, too, did not have a lot of Japanese American friends when she was growing up. When Yamaguchi began to pursue medical education at the University of California, San Francisco, in 1971, she realized how her lack of exposure to professional role models, as well as her experience of growing up in an extremely ""non-verbal"" family, made it a challenge for her to be in a decision-making position. She describes herself as being only ""around on the fringes"" of the Asian American activism in the 1970s. She joined the East Bay Socialist Doctors Group and the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and through members of these groups, she learned in the early 1980s about US survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. She was struck by their graciousness and gratefulness to physicians who offered the needed medical care. ""Given what they've gone through,"" Yamaguchi says, she felt it necessary to assist US hibakusha. She supports a single-payer health care system, and feels that US survivors are one of many groups that have been disadvantaged by the absence of such a system. Yamaguchi also enjoys working with Japanese physicians from Hiroshima who come biannually to conduct a health checkup for American hibakusha. She joined the Sansei Legacy Project beginning in 1990, which put her more in touch with her feelings about being raised by the parents who had been incarcerated during the war. She also made many more Japanese American friends through her participation in the group.
